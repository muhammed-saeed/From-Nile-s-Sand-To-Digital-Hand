▁ thy ▁ ways ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ devices ▁ have ▁ brought ▁ these ▁ things ▁ upon ▁ thee; ▁ this ▁ is ▁ thy ▁ wickedness, ▁ for ▁ it ▁ is ▁ bitter, ▁ for ▁ it ▁ has ▁ reached ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ heart .
▁ a ▁ lie ▁ is ▁ a ▁ foul ▁ blot ▁ in ▁ a ▁ man, ▁ yet ▁ it ▁ is ▁ continually ▁ in ▁ the ▁ mouth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ untaught .
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ men ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ out ▁ of ▁ their ▁ places, ▁ and ▁ engaged ▁ in ▁ baal ▁ thamar; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ liers ▁ in ▁ wait ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ advanced ▁ from ▁ their ▁ place ▁ from ▁ maraagabe .
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ give ▁ the ▁ levites ▁ to ▁ aaron, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ his ▁ sons ▁ the ▁ priests; ▁ they ▁ are ▁ given ▁ for ▁ a ▁ gift ▁ to ▁ me ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ but ▁ from ▁ those ▁ who ▁ were ▁ reputed ▁ to ▁ be ▁ important ▁ (whatever ▁ they ▁ were, ▁ it ▁ makes ▁ no ▁ difference ▁ to ▁ me; ▁ god ▁ doesn't ▁ show ▁ partiality ▁ to ▁ man)--they, ▁ i ▁ say, ▁ who ▁ were ▁ respected ▁ imparted ▁ nothing ▁ to ▁ me,
▁ but ▁ his ▁ form ▁ was ▁ ignoble, ▁ and ▁ inferior ▁ to ▁ that ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ men; ▁ he ▁ was ▁ a ▁ man ▁ in ▁ suffering, ▁ and ▁ acquainted ▁ with ▁ the ▁ bearing ▁ of ▁ sickness, ▁ for ▁ his ▁ face ▁ is ▁ turned ▁ from ▁ us: ▁ he ▁ was ▁ dishonoured, ▁ and ▁ not ▁ esteemed .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ uncover ▁ the ▁ nakedness ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ father, ▁ or ▁ the ▁ nakedness ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ mother, ▁ for ▁ she ▁ is ▁ thy ▁ mother; ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ uncover ▁ her ▁ nakedness .
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ take ▁ of ▁ the ▁ anointing ▁ oil, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ pour ▁ it ▁ on ▁ his ▁ head, ▁ and ▁ shalt ▁ anoint ▁ him,
▁ go, ▁ say ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ return ▁ ye ▁ to ▁ your ▁ houses;
▁ for ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ guard ▁ thee ▁ is ▁ exalted, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ together ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ rejoice: ▁ for ▁ eyes ▁ shall ▁ look ▁ to ▁ eyes, ▁ when ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ mercy ▁ upon ▁ sion .
▁ i ▁ saw ▁ the ▁ dead, ▁ the ▁ great ▁ and ▁ the ▁ small, ▁ standing ▁ before ▁ the ▁ throne, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ opened ▁ books . ▁ another ▁ book ▁ was ▁ opened, ▁ which ▁ is ▁ the ▁ book ▁ of ▁ life . ▁ the ▁ dead ▁ were ▁ judged ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ were ▁ written ▁ in ▁ the ▁ books, ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ works .
▁ the ▁ lord ▁ hath ▁ cast ▁ down ▁ the ▁ thrones ▁ of ▁ proud ▁ princes, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ up ▁ the ▁ meek ▁ in ▁ their ▁ stead .
▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'full ▁ of ▁ all ▁ deceit ▁ and ▁ all ▁ cunning, ▁ you ▁ son ▁ of ▁ the ▁ devil, ▁ you ▁ enemy ▁ of ▁ all ▁ righteousness, ▁ will ▁ you ▁ not ▁ cease ▁ to ▁ pervert ▁ the ▁ right ▁ ways ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord?
▁ one ▁ of ▁ them, ▁ when ▁ he ▁ saw ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ healed, ▁ turned ▁ back, ▁ glorifying ▁ god ▁ with ▁ a ▁ loud ▁ voice .
▁ they ▁ have ▁ sharpened ▁ their ▁ tongue ▁ as ▁ the ▁ tongue ▁ of ▁ a ▁ serpent; ▁ the ▁ poison ▁ of ▁ asps ▁ is ▁ under ▁ their ▁ lips . ▁ pause .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ border ▁ shall ▁ compass ▁ from ▁ asemona ▁ to ▁ the ▁ river ▁ of ▁ egypt, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ sea ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ the ▁ termination .
▁ and ▁ david ▁ feared ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ that ▁ day, ▁ saying, ▁ how ▁ shall ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ come ▁ in ▁ to ▁ me?
▁ take ▁ up ▁ a ▁ lamentation ▁ for ▁ the ▁ mountains, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ mournful ▁ dirge ▁ for ▁ the ▁ paths ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wilderness, ▁ for ▁ they ▁ are ▁ desolate ▁ for ▁ want ▁ of ▁ men; ▁ they ▁ heard ▁ not ▁ the ▁ sound ▁ of ▁ life ▁ from ▁ the ▁ birds ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sky, ▁ nor ▁ the ▁ cattle: ▁ they ▁ were ▁ amazed, ▁ they ▁ are ▁ gone .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ used ▁ to ▁ answer ▁ me ▁ from ▁ the ▁ inside ▁ of ▁ his ▁ cell, ▁ saying, ▁ 'get ▁ thee ▁ gone! ▁ in ▁ coming ▁ hither ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ given ▁ thyself ▁ trouble ▁ [to ▁ no ▁ purpose] .
▁ and ▁ catanath, ▁ and ▁ nabaal, ▁ and ▁ symoon, ▁ and ▁ jericho, ▁ and ▁ baethman .
▁ extol ▁ not ▁ thyself ▁ in ▁ the ▁ counsel ▁ of ▁ thine ▁ own ▁ heart; ▁ that ▁ thy ▁ soul ▁ be ▁ not ▁ torn ▁ in ▁ pieces ▁ as ▁ a ▁ bull ▁ straying ▁ alone .
▁ if ▁ ye ▁ should ▁ fear ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ serve ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ his ▁ voice, ▁ and ▁ not ▁ resist ▁ the ▁ mouth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ and ▁ your ▁ king ▁ that ▁ reigns ▁ over ▁ you ▁ should ▁ follow ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ well .
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ kings ▁ the ▁ servants ▁ of ▁ adraazar ▁ saw ▁ that ▁ they ▁ were ▁ put ▁ to ▁ the ▁ worse ▁ before ▁ israel, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ went ▁ over ▁ to ▁ israel, ▁ and ▁ served ▁ them: ▁ and ▁ syria ▁ was ▁ afraid ▁ to ▁ help ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ ammon ▁ any ▁ more .
▁ a ▁ man's ▁ own ▁ wealth ▁ is ▁ the ▁ ransom ▁ of ▁ his ▁ life: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ poor ▁ endures ▁ not ▁ threatening .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ had ▁ a ▁ signal ▁ of ▁ battle ▁ with ▁ the ▁ liers ▁ in ▁ wait, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ should ▁ send ▁ up ▁ a ▁ signal ▁ of ▁ smoke ▁ from ▁ the ▁ city .
▁ if ▁ it ▁ had ▁ not ▁ been ▁ that ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ was ▁ among ▁ us, ▁ let ▁ israel ▁ now ▁ say;
▁ take ▁ hold ▁ of ▁ shield ▁ and ▁ buckler, ▁ and ▁ arise ▁ for ▁ my ▁ help .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ put ▁ the ▁ incense ▁ on ▁ the ▁ fire ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ smoke ▁ of ▁ the ▁ incense ▁ shall ▁ cover ▁ the ▁ mercy-seat ▁ over ▁ the ▁ tables ▁ of ▁ testimony, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ die .
▁ and ▁ there ▁ are ▁ seven ▁ stars ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heavens ▁ which ▁ are ▁ called ▁ 'the ▁ gods'; ▁ those ▁ which ▁ are ▁ there ▁ are ▁ not ▁ permitted
▁ let ▁ us ▁ hold ▁ fast ▁ the ▁ confession ▁ of ▁ our ▁ hope ▁ without ▁ wavering; ▁ for ▁ he ▁ who ▁ promised ▁ is ▁ faithful .
▁ nan
▁ he ▁ heals ▁ the ▁ broken ▁ in ▁ heart, ▁ and ▁ binds ▁ up ▁ their ▁ wounds .
▁ while ▁ they ▁ went ▁ away ▁ to ▁ buy, ▁ the ▁ bridegroom ▁ came, ▁ and ▁ those ▁ who ▁ were ▁ ready ▁ went ▁ in ▁ with ▁ him ▁ to ▁ the ▁ marriage ▁ feast, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ door ▁ was ▁ shut .
▁ now ▁ if ▁ any ▁ man ▁ shall ▁ ask ▁ in ▁ a ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ contentiousness ▁ why ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ man ▁ said ▁ this,
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ gave ▁ to ▁ half ▁ the ▁ tribe ▁ of ▁ manasse ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ families .
▁ thou ▁ art ▁ all ▁ fair, ▁ my ▁ companion, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ spot ▁ in ▁ thee .
▁ but ▁ the ▁ field ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ holy ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ after ▁ the ▁ release, ▁ as ▁ separated ▁ land; ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ possession ▁ of ▁ it .
▁ but ▁ you ▁ are ▁ those ▁ who ▁ have ▁ continued ▁ with ▁ me ▁ in ▁ my ▁ trials .
▁ if ▁ he ▁ were ▁ to ▁ exact ▁ punishment ▁ from ▁ us ▁ for ▁ our ▁ carelessness ▁ in ▁ our ▁ assemblies ▁ for ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ communion, ▁ wherein ▁ god ▁ himself ▁ speaketh ▁ to ▁ us ▁ in ▁ the ▁ scriptures,
▁ what ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ say, ▁ or ▁ with ▁ what ▁ words ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ describe ▁ all ▁ the ▁ glorious ▁ virtues ▁ of ▁ this ▁ glorious, ▁ and ▁ just, ▁ and ▁ blessed ▁ man?
▁ all ▁ the ▁ families ▁ that ▁ are ▁ left, ▁ each ▁ family ▁ by ▁ itself, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ wives ▁ by ▁ themselves .
▁ let ▁ my ▁ prayer ▁ be ▁ set ▁ forth ▁ before ▁ thee ▁ as ▁ incense; ▁ the ▁ lifting ▁ up ▁ of ▁ my ▁ hands ▁ as ▁ an ▁ evening ▁ sacrifice .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ afraid ▁ to ▁ say ▁ it: ▁ let ▁ no ▁ man ▁ drink ▁ wine ▁ at ▁ all, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ he ▁ may ▁ not ▁ hate ▁ his ▁ own ▁ salvation ▁ (and) ▁ murmur ▁ against ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ lift ▁ up ▁ the ▁ sheaf ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ to ▁ be ▁ accepted ▁ for ▁ you . ▁ on ▁ the ▁ morrow ▁ of ▁ the ▁ first ▁ day ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ shall ▁ lift ▁ it ▁ up .
▁ who ▁ is ▁ the ▁ father ▁ of ▁ the ▁ orphans, ▁ and ▁ judge ▁ of ▁ the ▁ widows: ▁ such ▁ is ▁ god ▁ in ▁ his ▁ holy ▁ place .
▁ saying, ▁ 'go ▁ to ▁ this ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ say, ▁ in ▁ hearing, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ hear, ▁ but ▁ will ▁ in ▁ no ▁ way ▁ understand . ▁ in ▁ seeing, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ see, ▁ but ▁ will ▁ in ▁ no ▁ way ▁ perceive .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ tribes ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ sent ▁ men ▁ through ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ tribe ▁ of ▁ benjamin, ▁ saying, ▁ what ▁ is ▁ this ▁ wickedness ▁ that ▁ has ▁ been ▁ wrought ▁ among ▁ you?
▁ to ▁ proclaim ▁ thy ▁ mercy ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ truth ▁ by ▁ night,
▁ seventy ▁ weeks ▁ have ▁ been ▁ determined ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ city, ▁ for ▁ sin ▁ to ▁ be ▁ ended, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ seal ▁ up ▁ transgressions, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ blot ▁ out ▁ the ▁ iniquities, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ make ▁ atonement ▁ for ▁ iniquities, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ bring ▁ in ▁ everlasting ▁ righteousness, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ seal ▁ the ▁ vision ▁ and ▁ the ▁ prophet, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ anoint ▁ the ▁ most ▁ holy .
▁ then ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ not ▁ be ▁ ashamed, ▁ when ▁ i ▁ have ▁ respect ▁ to ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ commandments .
▁ a ▁ deceitful ▁ man ▁ shall ▁ catch ▁ no ▁ game; ▁ but ▁ a ▁ blameless ▁ man ▁ is ▁ a ▁ precious ▁ possession .
▁ there ▁ is ▁ one ▁ wise ▁ and ▁ greatly ▁ to ▁ be ▁ feared, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ sitting ▁ upon ▁ his ▁ throne .
▁ 'it ▁ will ▁ be ▁ in ▁ the ▁ last ▁ days, ▁ says ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ i ▁ will ▁ pour ▁ out ▁ my ▁ spirit ▁ on ▁ all ▁ flesh . ▁ your ▁ sons ▁ and ▁ your ▁ daughters ▁ will ▁ prophesy . ▁ your ▁ young ▁ men ▁ will ▁ see ▁ visions . ▁ your ▁ old ▁ men ▁ will ▁ dream ▁ dreams .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ any ▁ one ▁ should ▁ lie ▁ with ▁ his ▁ father's ▁ wife, ▁ he ▁ has ▁ uncovered ▁ his ▁ father's ▁ nakedness: ▁ let ▁ them ▁ both ▁ die ▁ the ▁ death, ▁ they ▁ are ▁ guilty .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ man ▁ whosoever ▁ shall ▁ act ▁ in ▁ haughtiness, ▁ so ▁ as ▁ not ▁ to ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ who ▁ stands ▁ to ▁ minister ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god, ▁ or ▁ the ▁ judge ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ preside ▁ in ▁ those ▁ days, ▁ that ▁ man ▁ shall ▁ die, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ remove ▁ the ▁ evil ▁ one ▁ out ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ and ▁ john ▁ and ▁ the ▁ monk ▁ rose ▁ up,
▁ the ▁ sinner ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ escape ▁ with ▁ his ▁ spoils: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ patience ▁ of ▁ the ▁ godly ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ frustrate .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ ramesses, ▁ and ▁ encamped ▁ in ▁ socchoth:
▁ in ▁ the ▁ same ▁ way ▁ a ▁ levite ▁ also, ▁ when ▁ he ▁ came ▁ to ▁ the ▁ place, ▁ and ▁ saw ▁ him, ▁ passed ▁ by ▁ on ▁ the ▁ other ▁ side .
▁ 'but ▁ woe ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ scribes ▁ and ▁ pharisees, ▁ hypocrites! ▁ because ▁ you ▁ shut ▁ up ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ heaven ▁ against ▁ men; ▁ for ▁ you ▁ don't ▁ enter ▁ in ▁ yourselves, ▁ neither ▁ do ▁ you ▁ allow ▁ those ▁ who ▁ are ▁ entering ▁ in ▁ to ▁ enter .
▁ deliver ▁ me ▁ from ▁ the ▁ false ▁ accusation ▁ of ▁ men: ▁ so ▁ will ▁ i ▁ keep ▁ thy ▁ commandments .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ beeroth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ jakim ▁ to ▁ misadai: ▁ there ▁ aaron ▁ died, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ he ▁ was ▁ buried, ▁ and ▁ eleazar ▁ his ▁ son ▁ was ▁ priest ▁ in ▁ his ▁ stead .
▁ the ▁ blind ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lame ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him ▁ in ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ healed ▁ them .
▁ about ▁ judgment, ▁ because ▁ the ▁ prince ▁ of ▁ this ▁ world ▁ has ▁ been ▁ judged .
▁ in ▁ like ▁ manner ▁ the ▁ second ▁ also, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ third, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ seventh .
▁ and ▁ israel ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ go ▁ and ▁ see ▁ if ▁ thy ▁ brethren ▁ and ▁ the ▁ sheep ▁ are ▁ well, ▁ and ▁ bring ▁ me ▁ word; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ sent ▁ him ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ valley ▁ of ▁ chebron, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ came ▁ to ▁ sychem .
▁ i ▁ glorified ▁ you ▁ on ▁ the ▁ earth . ▁ i ▁ have ▁ accomplished ▁ the ▁ work ▁ which ▁ you ▁ have ▁ given ▁ me ▁ to ▁ do .
▁ and ▁ whoever ▁ shall ▁ lie ▁ with ▁ a ▁ male ▁ as ▁ with ▁ a ▁ woman, ▁ they ▁ have ▁ both ▁ wrought ▁ abomination; ▁ let ▁ them ▁ die ▁ the ▁ death, ▁ they ▁ are ▁ guilty .
▁ take ▁ heed ▁ to ▁ thyself, ▁ and ▁ keep ▁ thy ▁ heart ▁ diligently: ▁ forget ▁ not ▁ any ▁ of ▁ the ▁ things, ▁ which ▁ thine ▁ eyes ▁ have ▁ seen, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ them ▁ not ▁ depart ▁ from ▁ thine ▁ heart ▁ all ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ life; ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ teach ▁ thy ▁ sons ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ sons' ▁ sons,
▁ yea, ▁ even ▁ if ▁ i ▁ should ▁ walk ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ the ▁ shadow ▁ of ▁ death, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ be ▁ afraid ▁ of ▁ evils: ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ with ▁ me; ▁ thy ▁ rod ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ staff, ▁ these ▁ have ▁ comforted ▁ me .
▁ some ▁ men's ▁ sins ▁ are ▁ evident, ▁ preceding ▁ them ▁ to ▁ judgment, ▁ and ▁ some ▁ also ▁ follow ▁ later .
▁ a ▁ fool ▁ scorns ▁ his ▁ father's ▁ instruction; ▁ but ▁ he ▁ that ▁ keeps ▁ his ▁ commandments ▁ is ▁ more ▁ prudent . ▁ in ▁ abounding ▁ righteousness ▁ is ▁ great ▁ strength: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ ungodly ▁ shall ▁ utterly ▁ perish ▁ from ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ had ▁ found ▁ him, ▁ he ▁ brought ▁ him ▁ to ▁ antioch . ▁ it ▁ happened, ▁ that ▁ for ▁ a ▁ whole ▁ year ▁ they ▁ were ▁ gathered ▁ together ▁ with ▁ the ▁ assembly, ▁ and ▁ taught ▁ many ▁ people . ▁ the ▁ disciples ▁ were ▁ first ▁ called ▁ christians ▁ in ▁ antioch .
▁ let ▁ not ▁ the ▁ foot ▁ of ▁ pride ▁ come ▁ against ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ not ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ sinners ▁ move ▁ me .
▁ proving ▁ what ▁ is ▁ well ▁ pleasing ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ for ▁ in ▁ the ▁ gospel ▁ certain ▁ virgins ▁ were ▁ rejected ▁ because ▁ of ▁ their ▁ careless ▁ slothfulness, ▁ whilst ▁ those ▁ who ▁ watched ▁ bravely ▁ went ▁ into ▁ the ▁ chamber ▁ of ▁ the ▁ bridegroom .
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ finished ▁ speaking ▁ all ▁ these ▁ words ▁ to ▁ all ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel;
▁ others, ▁ testing ▁ him, ▁ sought ▁ from ▁ him ▁ a ▁ sign ▁ from ▁ heaven .
▁ let ▁ not ▁ them ▁ that ▁ wait ▁ on ▁ thee, ▁ o ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ hosts, ▁ be ▁ ashamed ▁ on ▁ my ▁ account: ▁ let ▁ not ▁ them ▁ that ▁ seek ▁ thee, ▁ be ▁ ashamed ▁ on ▁ my ▁ account, ▁ o ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ but ▁ you ▁ are ▁ not ▁ in ▁ the ▁ flesh ▁ but ▁ in ▁ the ▁ spirit, ▁ if ▁ it ▁ is ▁ so ▁ that ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ god ▁ dwells ▁ in ▁ you . ▁ but ▁ if ▁ any ▁ man ▁ doesn't ▁ have ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ christ, ▁ he ▁ is ▁ not ▁ his .
▁ a ▁ great ▁ multitude ▁ followed ▁ him, ▁ because ▁ they ▁ saw ▁ his ▁ signs ▁ which ▁ he ▁ did ▁ on ▁ those ▁ who ▁ were ▁ sick .
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ egyptians ▁ shall ▁ know ▁ that ▁ i ▁ am ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ when ▁ i ▁ am ▁ glorified ▁ upon ▁ pharao ▁ and ▁ upon ▁ his ▁ chariots ▁ and ▁ his ▁ horses .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ king ▁ said, ▁ is ▁ the ▁ young ▁ man ▁ abessalom ▁ safe? ▁ and ▁ achimaas ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ saw ▁ a ▁ great ▁ multitude ▁ at ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ joab's ▁ sending ▁ the ▁ king's ▁ servant ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ servant, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ knew ▁ not ▁ what ▁ was ▁ there .
▁ and ▁ aeochioza, ▁ and ▁ naphlazon, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ cities ▁ of ▁ sadon, ▁ and ▁ ancades; ▁ seven ▁ cities, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ villages .
▁ when ▁ the ▁ disciples ▁ saw ▁ him ▁ walking ▁ on ▁ the ▁ sea, ▁ they ▁ were ▁ troubled, ▁ saying, ▁ 'it's ▁ a ▁ ghost!' ▁ and ▁ they ▁ cried ▁ out ▁ for ▁ fear .
▁ and ▁ elius ▁ continued, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ again ▁ speak,
▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ say ▁ unto ▁ thee, ▁ c ▁ didst ▁ thou, ▁ then, ▁ not ▁ hear ▁ god ▁ who ▁ cried ▁ out ▁ saying, ▁ 'the ▁ kingdom ▁ which ▁ is ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heavens ▁ hath ▁ drawn ▁ nigh?'
▁ how ▁ long ▁ wilt ▁ thou ▁ smite, ▁ o ▁ sword ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord? ▁ how ▁ long ▁ will ▁ it ▁ be ▁ ere ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ quiet? ▁ return ▁ into ▁ thy ▁ sheath, ▁ rest, ▁ and ▁ be ▁ removed .
▁ as ▁ jesus ▁ was ▁ going ▁ up ▁ to ▁ jerusalem, ▁ he ▁ took ▁ the ▁ twelve ▁ disciples ▁ aside, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ the ▁ way ▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them,
▁ amazement ▁ came ▁ on ▁ all, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ spoke ▁ together, ▁ one ▁ with ▁ another, ▁ saying, ▁ 'what ▁ is ▁ this ▁ word? ▁ for ▁ with ▁ authority ▁ and ▁ power ▁ he ▁ commands ▁ the ▁ unclean ▁ spirits, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ come ▁ out!'
▁ and ▁ when ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ saw ▁ that ▁ he ▁ drew ▁ nigh ▁ to ▁ see, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ called ▁ him ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ bush, ▁ saying, ▁ moses, ▁ moses; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ what ▁ is ▁ it?
▁ what ▁ do ▁ ye ▁ devise ▁ against ▁ the ▁ lord? ▁ he ▁ will ▁ make ▁ a ▁ complete ▁ end: ▁ he ▁ will ▁ not ▁ take ▁ vengeance ▁ by ▁ affliction ▁ twice ▁ at ▁ the ▁ same ▁ time .
▁ it ▁ is ▁ doubtless ▁ not ▁ profitable ▁ for ▁ me ▁ to ▁ boast . ▁ for ▁ i ▁ will ▁ come ▁ to ▁ visions ▁ and ▁ revelations ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ prayed, ▁ saying, ▁ 'o ▁ lord ▁ god, ▁ thou ▁ merciful ▁ one, ▁ who ▁ deliverest ▁ every ▁ one ▁ who ▁ putteth ▁ his ▁ hope ▁ in ▁ thee, ▁ since ▁ i ▁ have ▁ seen ▁ those ▁ who ▁ formerly ▁ walked ▁ with ▁ me ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ i ▁ have ▁ hope?
▁ who ▁ by ▁ the ▁ power ▁ of ▁ god ▁ are ▁ guarded ▁ through ▁ faith ▁ for ▁ a ▁ salvation ▁ ready ▁ to ▁ be ▁ revealed ▁ in ▁ the ▁ last ▁ time .
▁ and ▁ now ▁ if ▁ there ▁ are ▁ under ▁ thy ▁ hand ▁ five ▁ loaves, ▁ give ▁ into ▁ my ▁ hand ▁ what ▁ is ▁ ready .
▁ i ▁ have ▁ spread ▁ my ▁ bed ▁ with ▁ sheets, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ covered ▁ it ▁ with ▁ double ▁ tapestry ▁ from ▁ egypt .
▁ who ▁ establishes ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ on ▁ her ▁ sure ▁ foundation: ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ moved ▁ for ▁ ever .
▁ not ▁ those ▁ who ▁ weep ▁ for ▁ the ▁ dead, ▁ or ▁ the ▁ loss ▁ of ▁ property,
▁ but ▁ the ▁ scriptures ▁ imprisoned ▁ all ▁ things ▁ under ▁ sin, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ promise ▁ by ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ might ▁ be ▁ given ▁ to ▁ those ▁ who ▁ believe .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ took ▁ up ▁ their ▁ goods, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ their ▁ property, ▁ which ▁ they ▁ had ▁ gotten ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ chanaan; ▁ they ▁ came ▁ into ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt, ▁ jacob, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ his ▁ seed ▁ with ▁ him .
▁ mark ▁ ye ▁ well ▁ her ▁ strength, ▁ and ▁ observe ▁ her ▁ palaces; ▁ that ▁ ye ▁ may ▁ tell ▁ the ▁ next ▁ generation .
▁ and, ▁ moreover, ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ become ▁ rich ▁ in ▁ spiritual ▁ excellence .
▁ for ▁ this ▁ is ▁ my ▁ covenant ▁ which ▁ i ▁ will ▁ make ▁ with ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ israel; ▁ after ▁ those ▁ days, ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ surely ▁ put ▁ my ▁ laws ▁ into ▁ their ▁ mind, ▁ and ▁ write ▁ them ▁ on ▁ their ▁ hearts; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ be ▁ to ▁ them ▁ a ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ to ▁ me ▁ a ▁ people .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ have ▁ this ▁ against ▁ you, ▁ that ▁ you ▁ left ▁ your ▁ first ▁ love .
▁ and ▁ noemin ▁ seeing ▁ that ▁ she ▁ was ▁ determined ▁ to ▁ go ▁ with ▁ her, ▁ ceased ▁ to ▁ speak ▁ to ▁ her ▁ any ▁ more .
▁ there ▁ is ▁ nothing ▁ remaining ▁ of ▁ his ▁ provisions; ▁ therefore ▁ his ▁ goods ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ flourish .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ joshua, ▁ saying,
▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'i ▁ have ▁ observed ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things ▁ from ▁ my ▁ youth ▁ up . '
▁ let ▁ us ▁ examine ▁ carefully ▁ the ▁ seal ▁ which ▁ is ▁ on ▁ our ▁ gold ▁ and ▁ see ▁ that ▁ it ▁ is ▁ intact, ▁ lest ▁ peradventure ▁ some ▁ come ▁ and ▁ plunder ▁ our ▁ treasure .
▁ and ▁ man ▁ being ▁ in ▁ honour, ▁ understands ▁ not: ▁ he ▁ is ▁ compared ▁ to ▁ the ▁ senseless ▁ cattle, ▁ and ▁ is ▁ like ▁ to ▁ them .
▁ and ▁ likewise ▁ their ▁ gods ▁ of ▁ wood, ▁ and ▁ laid ▁ over ▁ with ▁ silver ▁ and ▁ gold, ▁ are ▁ like ▁ to ▁ a ▁ white ▁ thorn ▁ in ▁ an ▁ orchard, ▁ that ▁ every ▁ bird ▁ sitteth ▁ upon; ▁ as ▁ also ▁ to ▁ a ▁ dead ▁ body, ▁ that ▁ is ▁ east ▁ into ▁ the ▁ dark .
▁ and ▁ believe ▁ me, ▁ for ▁ she ▁ is ▁ a ▁ free ▁ woman .
▁ her ▁ parents ▁ were ▁ amazed, ▁ but ▁ he ▁ commanded ▁ them ▁ to ▁ tell ▁ no ▁ one ▁ what ▁ had ▁ been ▁ done .
▁ so ▁ shall ▁ all ▁ nations ▁ praise ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ people ▁ shall ▁ confess ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ shall ▁ exalt ▁ his ▁ people; ▁ and ▁ all ▁ those ▁ which ▁ love ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ in ▁ truth ▁ and ▁ justice ▁ shall ▁ rejoice, ▁ shewing ▁ mercy ▁ to ▁ our ▁ brethren .

▁ so ▁ will ▁ it ▁ be ▁ in ▁ the ▁ end ▁ of ▁ the ▁ world . ▁ the ▁ angels ▁ will ▁ come ▁ forth, ▁ and ▁ separate ▁ the ▁ wicked ▁ from ▁ among ▁ the ▁ righteous,
▁ but ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things ▁ are ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ of ▁ birth ▁ pains .
▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'this ▁ is ▁ what ▁ i ▁ will ▁ do . ▁ i ▁ will ▁ pull ▁ down ▁ my ▁ barns, ▁ and ▁ build ▁ bigger ▁ ones, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ i ▁ will ▁ store ▁ all ▁ my ▁ grain ▁ and ▁ my ▁ goods .

▁ and ▁ when ▁ the ▁ morning ▁ had ▁ come ▁ the ▁ duke ▁ took ▁ his ▁ seat ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ throne, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ commanded ▁ his ▁ servants ▁ to ▁ bring ▁ the ▁ righteous ▁ man ▁ into ▁ his ▁ presence .

▁ i ▁ heard ▁ a ▁ loud ▁ voice ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ saying ▁ to ▁ the ▁ seven ▁ angels, ▁ 'go ▁ and ▁ pour ▁ out ▁ the ▁ seven ▁ bowls ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wrath ▁ of ▁ god ▁ on ▁ the ▁ earth!'
▁ she ▁ that ▁ bore ▁ seven ▁ is ▁ spent; ▁ her ▁ soul ▁ has ▁ fainted ▁ under ▁ trouble; ▁ her ▁ sun ▁ is ▁ gone ▁ down ▁ while ▁ it ▁ is ▁ yet ▁ noon; ▁ she ▁ is ▁ ashamed ▁ and ▁ disgraced: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ give ▁ the ▁ remnant ▁ of ▁ them ▁ to ▁ the ▁ sword ▁ before ▁ their ▁ enemies .
▁ he ▁ saw ▁ two ▁ boats ▁ standing ▁ by ▁ the ▁ lake, ▁ but ▁ the ▁ fishermen ▁ had ▁ gone ▁ out ▁ of ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ were ▁ washing ▁ their ▁ nets .
▁ penetrate ▁ my ▁ flesh ▁ with ▁ thy ▁ fear; ▁ for ▁ i ▁ am ▁ afraid ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ judgments .
▁ as ▁ those ▁ who ▁ need ▁ correction ▁ put ▁ forth ▁ fair ▁ words ▁ to ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ that ▁ first ▁ falls ▁ in ▁ with ▁ the ▁ proposal ▁ will ▁ be ▁ overthrown;
▁ now ▁ there ▁ was ▁ a ▁ man ▁ of ▁ the ▁ pharisees ▁ named ▁ nicodemus, ▁ a ▁ ruler ▁ of ▁ the ▁ jews .
▁ but ▁ jesus ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'leave ▁ the ▁ dead ▁ to ▁ bury ▁ their ▁ own ▁ dead, ▁ but ▁ you ▁ go ▁ and ▁ announce ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ god . '

▁ and ▁ the ▁ people ▁ stole ▁ away ▁ that ▁ day ▁ to ▁ go ▁ into ▁ the ▁ city, ▁ as ▁ people ▁ steal ▁ away ▁ when ▁ they ▁ are ▁ ashamed ▁ as ▁ they ▁ flee ▁ in ▁ the ▁ battle .
▁ go, ▁ eat ▁ thy ▁ bread ▁ with ▁ mirth, ▁ and ▁ drink ▁ thy ▁ wine ▁ with ▁ a ▁ joyful ▁ heart; ▁ for ▁ now ▁ god ▁ has ▁ favourably ▁ accepted ▁ thy ▁ works .
▁ from ▁ time ▁ to ▁ time, ▁ and ▁ at ▁ all ▁ times, ▁ rehearse ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ | ▁ scriptures,
▁ for ▁ even ▁ as ▁ jonah ▁ became ▁ a ▁ sign ▁ to ▁ the ▁ ninevites, ▁ so ▁ will ▁ also ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ man ▁ be ▁ to ▁ this ▁ generation .
▁ suddenly ▁ a ▁ great ▁ wind ▁ came ▁ on ▁ from ▁ the ▁ desert, ▁ and ▁ caught ▁ the ▁ four ▁ corners ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ house ▁ fell ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ children, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ are ▁ dead; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ escaped ▁ alone, ▁ and ▁ am ▁ come ▁ to ▁ tell ▁ thee .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ that ▁ when ▁ the ▁ man ▁ had ▁ taken ▁ his ▁ son, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ depart ▁ to ▁ his ▁ house, ▁ now, ▁ according ▁ to ▁ what ▁ the ▁ man ▁ himself ▁ confessed ▁ to ▁ me ▁ with ▁ his ▁ own ▁ mouth, ▁ (this ▁ happened) ▁ a ▁ few ▁ days ▁ after, ▁ whilst ▁ he ▁ was ▁ taking ▁ him ▁ back ▁ home, ▁ (and ▁ the ▁ man ▁ said), ▁ 'whilst ▁ i ▁ was ▁ walking ▁ along ▁ with ▁ my ▁ son,
▁ and ▁ i ▁ cast ▁ myself ▁ down ▁ at ▁ his ▁ feet ▁ so ▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ remember ▁ and ▁ bless ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ turned ▁ and ▁ came ▁ down ▁ from ▁ the ▁ mountain, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ put ▁ the ▁ tables ▁ into ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ which ▁ i ▁ had ▁ made; ▁ and ▁ there ▁ they ▁ were, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ commanded ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ fight ▁ against ▁ you ▁ with ▁ an ▁ outstretched ▁ hand ▁ and ▁ with ▁ a ▁ strong ▁ arm, ▁ with ▁ wrath ▁ and ▁ great ▁ anger .
▁ i ▁ heard ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ from ▁ heaven ▁ saying, ▁ 'write, ▁ 'blessed ▁ are ▁ the ▁ dead ▁ who ▁ die ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ from ▁ now ▁ on . '' ▁ 'yes,' ▁ says ▁ the ▁ spirit, ▁ 'that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ rest ▁ from ▁ their ▁ labors; ▁ for ▁ their ▁ works ▁ follow ▁ with ▁ them . '
▁ now, ▁ my ▁ father ▁ acted ▁ in ▁ this ▁ way ▁ and ▁ did ▁ not ▁ himself ▁ give ▁ the ▁ youth ▁ the ▁ water ▁ to ▁ drink ▁ with ▁ his ▁ own ▁ hands, ▁ and ▁ so ▁ make ▁ the ▁ demon ▁ come ▁ out ▁ from ▁ him ▁ immediately, ▁ lest ▁ men ▁ should ▁ ascribe ▁ praise ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ say, ▁ apa ▁ pisentius ▁ hath ▁ cast ▁ the ▁ demon ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ such ▁ and ▁ such ▁ a ▁ man, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ did ▁ not ▁ wish ▁ to ▁ receive ▁ glorifying ▁ from ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ men .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ seven ▁ years ▁ of ▁ famine ▁ began ▁ to ▁ come, ▁ as ▁ joseph ▁ said; ▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ a ▁ famine ▁ in ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land; ▁ but ▁ in ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt ▁ there ▁ was ▁ bread .
▁ on ▁ the ▁ next ▁ day ▁ a ▁ great ▁ multitude ▁ had ▁ come ▁ to ▁ the ▁ feast . ▁ when ▁ they ▁ heard ▁ that ▁ jesus ▁ was ▁ coming ▁ to ▁ jerusalem,
▁ and ▁ afterwards ▁ they ▁ lighted ▁ two ▁ hundred ▁ candles ▁ on ▁ golden ▁ candlesticks, ▁ and ▁ four ▁ hundred ▁ candles ▁ on ▁ silver ▁ candlesticks, ▁ and ▁ two ▁ hundred ▁ white ▁ horses ▁ drew ▁ his ▁ gods ▁ into ▁ the ▁ temple .
▁ but ▁ he ▁ answered ▁ them, ▁ 'my ▁ mother ▁ and ▁ my ▁ brothers ▁ are ▁ these ▁ who ▁ hear ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ do ▁ it . '
▁ these ▁ are ▁ unclean ▁ to ▁ you ▁ of ▁ all ▁ the ▁ reptiles ▁ which ▁ are ▁ on ▁ the ▁ earth; ▁ every ▁ one ▁ who ▁ touches ▁ their ▁ carcases ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ unclean ▁ till ▁ evening .
▁ for ▁ it ▁ is ▁ an ▁ easy ▁ thing ▁ unto ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ death ▁ to ▁ reward ▁ a ▁ man ▁ according ▁ to ▁ his ▁ ways .
▁ whensoever ▁ any ▁ man ▁ doeth ▁ unto ▁ thee ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ evil ▁ thou ▁ must ▁ do ▁ unto ▁ him ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ good ▁ in ▁ return .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ the ▁ master ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house ▁ wherein ▁ he ▁ lodged, ▁ ' ▁ i ▁ know ▁ these ▁ men .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ has ▁ laid ▁ bare ▁ the ▁ depths ▁ of ▁ rivers, ▁ and ▁ has ▁ brought ▁ his ▁ power ▁ to ▁ light .
▁ which ▁ they ▁ also ▁ did, ▁ sending ▁ it ▁ to ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ by ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ barnabas ▁ and ▁ saul .
▁ for ▁ what ▁ does ▁ it ▁ profit ▁ a ▁ man ▁ if ▁ he ▁ gains ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ world, ▁ and ▁ loses ▁ or ▁ forfeits ▁ his ▁ own ▁ self?
▁ and ▁ while ▁ he ▁ spoke ▁ with ▁ me, ▁ i ▁ fell ▁ upon ▁ my ▁ face ▁ to ▁ the ▁ earth: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ touched ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ me ▁ on ▁ my ▁ feet .
▁ knowest ▁ thou ▁ not ▁ the ▁ mischief ▁ of ▁ abenner ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ ner, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ came ▁ to ▁ deceive ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ know ▁ thy ▁ going ▁ out ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ coming ▁ in, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ know ▁ all ▁ things ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ doest?
▁ behold ▁ thou ▁ then, ▁ o ▁ god, ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ they ▁ are ▁ doing ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ see ▁ how ▁ they ▁ even ▁ dare ▁ to ▁ say ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ 'take ▁ thou ▁ thirty ▁ centenarii ▁ of ▁ gold, ▁ and ▁ deny ▁ jesus ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ this ▁ multitude . '
▁ and ▁ four ▁ loaves ▁ of ▁ bread ▁ have ▁ been ▁ allotted ▁ to ▁ us ▁ daily, ▁ and ▁ these ▁ came ▁ to ▁ us ▁ through ▁ god;
▁ cast ▁ about ▁ thee ▁ a ▁ double ▁ garment ▁ of ▁ the ▁ righteousness ▁ which ▁ cometh ▁ from ▁ god; ▁ and ▁ set ▁ a ▁ diadem ▁ on ▁ thine ▁ head ▁ of ▁ the ▁ glory ▁ of ▁ the ▁ everlasting .
▁ for ▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ drink ▁ at ▁ all ▁ again ▁ from ▁ the ▁ fruit ▁ of ▁ the ▁ vine, ▁ until ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ god ▁ comes . '
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ o ▁ ever ▁ living ▁ lord! ▁ behold, ▁ their ▁ prophets ▁ prophesy, ▁ and ▁ say, ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ see ▁ a ▁ sword, ▁ nor ▁ shall ▁ famine ▁ be ▁ among ▁ you; ▁ for ▁ i ▁ will ▁ give ▁ truth ▁ and ▁ peace ▁ on ▁ the ▁ land, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ this ▁ place .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ had ▁ gone ▁ out ▁ onto ▁ the ▁ porch, ▁ someone ▁ else ▁ saw ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ those ▁ who ▁ were ▁ there, ▁ 'this ▁ man ▁ also ▁ was ▁ with ▁ jesus ▁ of ▁ nazareth . '
▁ and ▁ far ▁ be ▁ it ▁ from ▁ me ▁ to ▁ sin ▁ against ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ ceasing ▁ to ▁ pray ▁ for ▁ you: ▁ but ▁ i ▁ will ▁ serve ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ shew ▁ you ▁ the ▁ good ▁ and ▁ the ▁ right ▁ way .
▁ for ▁ i ▁ have ▁ never ▁ seen ▁ a ▁ man ▁ who ▁ came ▁ to ▁ me ▁ except ▁ a ▁ certain ▁ brother ▁ who ▁ was ▁ a ▁ monk, ▁ and ▁ who ▁ came ▁ hither ▁ wishing ▁ to ▁ see ▁ my ▁ face, ▁ besides ▁ such ▁ a ▁ one ▁ i ▁ have ▁ never ▁ seen ▁ anyone .
▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ early ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ numbered ▁ the ▁ people; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ went ▁ up, ▁ he ▁ and ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ before ▁ the ▁ people ▁ to ▁ gai .
▁ and ▁ abraam ▁ set ▁ seven ▁ ewe-lambs ▁ by ▁ themselves .
▁ our ▁ fathers ▁ sinned, ▁ and ▁ are ▁ not: ▁ we ▁ have ▁ borne ▁ their ▁ iniquities .
▁ for ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ as ▁ my ▁ wrath ▁ has ▁ dropped ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ inhabitants ▁ of ▁ jerusalem, ▁ so ▁ shall ▁ my ▁ wrath ▁ drop ▁ upon ▁ you, ▁ when ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ entered ▁ into ▁ egypt: ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ a ▁ desolation, ▁ and ▁ under ▁ the ▁ power ▁ of ▁ others, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ curse ▁ and ▁ a ▁ reproach: ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ no ▁ more ▁ see ▁ this ▁ place .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ stand, ▁ i ▁ pray ▁ thee, ▁ over ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ slay ▁ me, ▁ for ▁ a ▁ dreadful ▁ darkness ▁ has ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ me, ▁ for ▁ all ▁ my ▁ life ▁ is ▁ in ▁ me .

▁ the ▁ sluggard ▁ says, ▁ i ▁ slumber ▁ a ▁ little, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ sleep ▁ a ▁ little, ▁ and ▁ for ▁ a ▁ little ▁ while ▁ i ▁ fold ▁ my ▁ arms ▁ across ▁ my ▁ breast .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ did ▁ this ▁ thing ▁ on ▁ the ▁ next ▁ day, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ cattle ▁ of ▁ the ▁ egyptians ▁ died, ▁ but ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cattle ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ there ▁ died ▁ not ▁ one .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ found ▁ a ▁ ship ▁ anchored ▁ at ▁ the ▁ quay, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ made ▁ enquiries ▁ aboiut ▁ embarking ▁ in ▁ the ▁ ship .
▁ i ▁ will ▁ surely ▁ bless ▁ her ▁ provision: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ satisfy ▁ her ▁ poor ▁ with ▁ bread .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ applied ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ to ▁ seek ▁ out ▁ and ▁ examine ▁ by ▁ wisdom ▁ concerning ▁ all ▁ things ▁ that ▁ are ▁ done ▁ under ▁ heaven, ▁ for ▁ god ▁ has ▁ given ▁ to ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ men ▁ an ▁ evil ▁ trouble ▁ to ▁ be ▁ troubled ▁ therewith .
▁ and ▁ again ▁ it ▁ was ▁ by ▁ the ▁ might ▁ of ▁ faith ▁ that ▁ a ▁ certain ▁ woman ▁ went ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ whose ▁ blood ▁ had ▁ been ▁ flowing ▁ from ▁ her ▁ for ▁ twelve ▁ years, ▁ and ▁ whom ▁ no ▁ man ▁ had ▁ been ▁ able ▁ to ▁ heal .
▁ and ▁ when ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ that ▁ bore ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ the ▁ covenant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ entered ▁ upon ▁ jordan, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ that ▁ bore ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ the ▁ covenant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ were ▁ dipped ▁ in ▁ part ▁ of ▁ the ▁ water ▁ of ▁ jordan; ▁ (now ▁ jordan ▁ overflowed ▁ all ▁ its ▁ banks ▁ about ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ wheat ▁ harvest:)
▁ then ▁ they ▁ spit ▁ in ▁ his ▁ face ▁ and ▁ beat ▁ him ▁ with ▁ their ▁ fists, ▁ and ▁ some ▁ slapped ▁ him,
▁ and ▁ he ▁ sent ▁ a ▁ dove ▁ after ▁ it ▁ to ▁ see ▁ if ▁ the ▁ water ▁ had ▁ ceased ▁ from ▁ off ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ he ▁ sends ▁ his ▁ oracle ▁ to ▁ the ▁ earth: ▁ his ▁ word ▁ will ▁ run ▁ swiftly .
▁ therefore ▁ shall ▁ they ▁ eat ▁ the ▁ fruits ▁ of ▁ their ▁ own ▁ way, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ filled ▁ with ▁ their ▁ own ▁ ungodliness .
▁ and ▁ blessed ▁ be ▁ thy ▁ conduct, ▁ and ▁ blessed ▁ be ▁ thou, ▁ who ▁ hast ▁ hindered ▁ me ▁ this ▁ very ▁ day ▁ from ▁ coming ▁ to ▁ shed ▁ blood, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ avenging ▁ myself .
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ turned ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ pray, ▁ lord, ▁ why ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ afflicted ▁ this ▁ people? ▁ and ▁ wherefore ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ sent ▁ me?
▁ i ▁ fell ▁ down ▁ before ▁ his ▁ feet ▁ to ▁ worship ▁ him . ▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ 'look! ▁ don't ▁ do ▁ it! ▁ i ▁ am ▁ a ▁ fellow ▁ bondservant ▁ with ▁ you ▁ and ▁ with ▁ your ▁ brothers ▁ who ▁ hold ▁ the ▁ testimony ▁ of ▁ jesus . ▁ worship ▁ god, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ testimony ▁ of ▁ jesus ▁ is ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ prophecy . '
▁ only ▁ god, ▁ unto ▁ whom ▁ all ▁ praise ▁ be ▁ given, ▁ knoweth ▁ it .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ have ▁ raised ▁ this ▁ expectation, ▁ yet ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ not ▁ remembered ▁ me, ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ behold, ▁ have ▁ not ▁ i ▁ made ▁ the ▁ bearing ▁ and ▁ barren ▁ woman? ▁ saith ▁ thy ▁ god .
▁ my ▁ heart ▁ was ▁ troubled ▁ within ▁ me; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ fear ▁ of ▁ death ▁ fell ▁ upon ▁ me .
▁ six ▁ days ▁ shalt ▁ thou ▁ eat ▁ unleavened ▁ bread, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ the ▁ seventh ▁ day ▁ is ▁ a ▁ holiday, ▁ a ▁ feast ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god: ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ do ▁ in ▁ it ▁ any ▁ work, ▁ save ▁ what ▁ must ▁ be ▁ done ▁ by ▁ any ▁ one .
▁ then ▁ the ▁ chief ▁ priests, ▁ the ▁ scribes, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people ▁ were ▁ gathered ▁ together ▁ in ▁ the ▁ court ▁ of ▁ the ▁ high ▁ priest, ▁ who ▁ was ▁ called ▁ caiaphas .
▁ 'now, ▁ brothers, ▁ i ▁ know ▁ that ▁ you ▁ did ▁ this ▁ in ▁ ignorance, ▁ as ▁ did ▁ also ▁ your ▁ rulers .
▁ the ▁ watchmen ▁ who ▁ go ▁ their ▁ rounds ▁ in ▁ the ▁ city ▁ found ▁ me . ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ have ▁ ye ▁ seen ▁ him ▁ whom ▁ my ▁ soul ▁ loves?
▁ everyone ▁ who ▁ has ▁ left ▁ houses, ▁ or ▁ brothers, ▁ or ▁ sisters, ▁ or ▁ father, ▁ or ▁ mother, ▁ or ▁ wife, ▁ or ▁ children, ▁ or ▁ lands, ▁ for ▁ my ▁ name's ▁ sake, ▁ will ▁ receive ▁ one ▁ hundred ▁ times, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ inherit ▁ eternal ▁ life .
▁ for ▁ we ▁ don't ▁ have ▁ a ▁ high ▁ priest ▁ who ▁ can't ▁ be ▁ touched ▁ with ▁ the ▁ feeling ▁ of ▁ our ▁ infirmities, ▁ but ▁ one ▁ who ▁ has ▁ been ▁ in ▁ all ▁ points ▁ tempted ▁ like ▁ we ▁ are, ▁ yet ▁ without ▁ sin .
▁ take ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ purify ▁ yourself ▁ with ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ pay ▁ their ▁ expenses ▁ for ▁ them, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ shave ▁ their ▁ heads . ▁ then ▁ all ▁ will ▁ know ▁ that ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ truth ▁ in ▁ the ▁ things ▁ that ▁ they ▁ have ▁ been ▁ informed ▁ about ▁ you, ▁ but ▁ that ▁ you ▁ yourself ▁ also ▁ walk ▁ keeping ▁ the ▁ law .
▁ perhaps ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ grief-stricken ▁ because ▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ taken ▁ for ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ wife ▁ thy ▁ bride
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ said, ▁ as ▁ my ▁ servant ▁ esaias ▁ has ▁ walked ▁ naked ▁ and ▁ barefoot ▁ three ▁ years, ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ three ▁ years ▁ for ▁ signs ▁ and ▁ wonders ▁ to ▁ the ▁ egyptians ▁ and ▁ ethiopians;
▁ for ▁ thy ▁ sons ▁ whom ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ lost ▁ shall ▁ say ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ ears, ▁ the ▁ place ▁ is ▁ too ▁ narrow ▁ for ▁ me: ▁ make ▁ room ▁ for ▁ me ▁ that ▁ i ▁ may ▁ dwell .
▁ and ▁ horion ▁ placed ▁ his ▁ napkin ▁ before ▁ his ▁ face .
▁ and ▁ nabuchodonosor ▁ heard ▁ them ▁ singing ▁ praises; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ wondered, ▁ and ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ in ▁ haste, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ his ▁ nobles, ▁ did ▁ we ▁ not ▁ cast ▁ three ▁ men ▁ bound ▁ into ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ the ▁ fire? ▁ and ▁ they ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ yes, ▁ o ▁ king .
▁ for ▁ surely ▁ man ▁ also ▁ knows ▁ not ▁ his ▁ time: ▁ as ▁ fishes ▁ that ▁ are ▁ taken ▁ in ▁ an ▁ evil ▁ net, ▁ and ▁ as ▁ birds ▁ that ▁ are ▁ caught ▁ in ▁ a ▁ snare; ▁ even ▁ thus ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ men ▁ are ▁ snared ▁ at ▁ an ▁ evil ▁ time, ▁ when ▁ it ▁ falls ▁ suddenly ▁ upon ▁ them .
▁ for ▁ jerusalem ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ built ▁ up ▁ with ▁ sapphires ▁ and ▁ emeralds, ▁ and ▁ precious ▁ stone: ▁ thy ▁ walls ▁ and ▁ towers ▁ and ▁ battlements ▁ with ▁ pure ▁ gold .
▁ but ▁ when ▁ some ▁ were ▁ hardened ▁ and ▁ disobedient, ▁ speaking ▁ evil ▁ of ▁ the ▁ way ▁ before ▁ the ▁ multitude, ▁ he ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ separated ▁ the ▁ disciples, ▁ reasoning ▁ daily ▁ in ▁ the ▁ school ▁ of ▁ tyrannus .
▁ now ▁ the ▁ fruit ▁ of ▁ righteousness ▁ is ▁ sown ▁ in ▁ peace ▁ by ▁ those ▁ who ▁ make ▁ peace .
▁ thou ▁ art ▁ my ▁ dove, ▁ in ▁ the ▁ shelter ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rock, ▁ near ▁ the ▁ wall: ▁ shew ▁ me ▁ thy ▁ face, ▁ and ▁ cause ▁ me ▁ to ▁ hear ▁ thy ▁ voice; ▁ for ▁ thy ▁ voice ▁ is ▁ sweet, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ countenance ▁ is ▁ beautiful .
▁ he ▁ came ▁ near ▁ and ▁ touched ▁ the ▁ coffin, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ bearers ▁ stood ▁ still . ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'young ▁ man, ▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ arise!'
▁ and ▁ laban ▁ said ▁ to ▁ jacob, ▁ what ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ done? ▁ wherefore ▁ didst ▁ thou ▁ run ▁ away ▁ secretly, ▁ and ▁ pillage ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ lead ▁ away ▁ my ▁ daughters ▁ as ▁ captives ▁ taken ▁ with ▁ the ▁ sword?

▁ and ▁ i ▁ inquired, ▁ and ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ the ▁ angel ▁ that ▁ talked ▁ with ▁ me, ▁ saying, ▁ what ▁ are ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ my ▁ lord?

▁ and ▁ memphibosthe ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ my ▁ lord, ▁ o ▁ king, ▁ my ▁ servant ▁ deceived ▁ me; ▁ for ▁ thy ▁ servant ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ saddle ▁ me ▁ the ▁ ass, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ ride ▁ upon ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ go ▁ with ▁ the ▁ king; ▁ for ▁ thy ▁ servant ▁ is ▁ lame .
