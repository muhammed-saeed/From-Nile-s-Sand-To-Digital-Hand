▁ and ▁ she ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ give ▁ me ▁ a ▁ blessing, ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ set ▁ me ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ nageb; ▁ give ▁ me ▁ botthanis: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ gave ▁ her ▁ gonaethla ▁ the ▁ upper, ▁ and ▁ gonaethla ▁ the ▁ lower .
▁ but ▁ if ▁ it ▁ seem ▁ not ▁ good ▁ to ▁ you ▁ to ▁ serve ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ choose ▁ to ▁ yourselves ▁ this ▁ day ▁ whom ▁ ye ▁ will ▁ serve, ▁ whether ▁ the ▁ gods ▁ of ▁ your ▁ fathers ▁ that ▁ were ▁ on ▁ the ▁ other ▁ side ▁ of ▁ the ▁ river, ▁ or ▁ the ▁ gods ▁ of ▁ the ▁ amorites, ▁ among ▁ whom ▁ ye ▁ dwell ▁ upon ▁ their ▁ land: ▁ but ▁ i ▁ and ▁ my ▁ house ▁ will ▁ serve ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ is ▁ holy .
▁ blessed ▁ among ▁ women ▁ be ▁ jael ▁ wife ▁ of ▁ chaber ▁ the ▁ kenite; ▁ let ▁ her ▁ be ▁ blessed ▁ above ▁ women ▁ in ▁ tents .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ provoked ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ forsook ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ served ▁ baal ▁ and ▁ the ▁ astartes .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ separate ▁ for ▁ thyself ▁ three ▁ cities ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ land, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ gives ▁ thee .
▁ lord, ▁ have ▁ mercy ▁ upon ▁ us; ▁ for ▁ we ▁ have ▁ trusted ▁ in ▁ thee: ▁ the ▁ seed ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rebellious ▁ is ▁ gone ▁ to ▁ destruction, ▁ but ▁ our ▁ deliverance ▁ was ▁ in ▁ a ▁ time ▁ of ▁ affliction .
▁ one ▁ who ▁ has ▁ my ▁ commandments, ▁ and ▁ keeps ▁ them, ▁ that ▁ person ▁ is ▁ one ▁ who ▁ loves ▁ me . ▁ one ▁ who ▁ loves ▁ me ▁ will ▁ be ▁ loved ▁ by ▁ my ▁ father, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ love ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ reveal ▁ myself ▁ to ▁ him . '
▁ every ▁ man ▁ praying ▁ or ▁ prophesying, ▁ having ▁ his ▁ head ▁ covered, ▁ dishonors ▁ his ▁ head .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ raised ▁ up ▁ a ▁ testimony ▁ in ▁ jacob, ▁ and ▁ appointed ▁ a ▁ law ▁ in ▁ israel, ▁ which ▁ he ▁ commanded ▁ our ▁ fathers, ▁ to ▁ make ▁ it ▁ known ▁ to ▁ their ▁ children:
▁ a ▁ great ▁ sign ▁ was ▁ seen ▁ in ▁ heaven: ▁ a ▁ woman ▁ clothed ▁ with ▁ the ▁ sun, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ moon ▁ under ▁ her ▁ feet, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ her ▁ head ▁ a ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ twelve ▁ stars .
▁ and ▁ his ▁ power ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ great, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ destroy ▁ wonderfully, ▁ and ▁ prosper, ▁ and ▁ practise, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ destroy ▁ mighty ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ people .
▁ for ▁ you ▁ yourselves ▁ know, ▁ brothers, ▁ our ▁ visit ▁ to ▁ you ▁ wasn't ▁ in ▁ vain,
▁ he ▁ called ▁ for ▁ lights ▁ and ▁ sprang ▁ in, ▁ and, ▁ fell ▁ down ▁ trembling ▁ before ▁ paul ▁ and ▁ silas,
▁ then ▁ tobit ▁ called ▁ his ▁ son ▁ tobias, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ him, ▁ my ▁ son, ▁ see ▁ that ▁ the ▁ man ▁ have ▁ his ▁ wages, ▁ which ▁ went ▁ with ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ must ▁ give ▁ him ▁ more .
▁ now ▁ according ▁ to ▁ the ▁ favourable ▁ opportunity ▁ afforded ▁ by ▁ god, ▁ the ▁ shepherd ▁ came ▁ into ▁ the ▁ chamber ▁ as ▁ soon ▁ as ▁ he ▁ found ▁ that ▁ the ▁ door ▁ was ▁ opened, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ cast ▁ himself ▁ down ▁ at ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ apa ▁ pisentius ▁ whilst ▁ the ▁ clergy ▁ who ▁ had ▁ been ▁ sent ▁ by ▁ the ▁ patriarch ▁ damianus ▁ were ▁ with ▁ him .
▁ nevertheless, ▁ let ▁ us ▁ declare ▁ a ▁ few ▁ things ▁ concerning ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ man, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ glory ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ war ▁ for ▁ a ▁ long ▁ time ▁ between ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ saul ▁ and ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ david; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ david ▁ grew ▁ continually ▁ stronger; ▁ but ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ saul ▁ grew ▁ continually ▁ weaker .
▁ the ▁ same ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him ▁ by ▁ night, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'rabbi, ▁ we ▁ know ▁ that ▁ you ▁ are ▁ a ▁ teacher ▁ come ▁ from ▁ god, ▁ for ▁ no ▁ one ▁ can ▁ do ▁ these ▁ signs ▁ that ▁ you ▁ do, ▁ unless ▁ god ▁ is ▁ with ▁ him . '
▁ let ▁ not ▁ thy ▁ foot ▁ be ▁ moved; ▁ and ▁ let ▁ not ▁ thy ▁ keeper ▁ slumber .
▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ not ▁ such ▁ a ▁ day ▁ either ▁ before ▁ or ▁ after, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ god ▁ should ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ a ▁ man, ▁ because ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ fought ▁ on ▁ the ▁ side ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ therefore ▁ they ▁ are ▁ before ▁ the ▁ throne ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ they ▁ serve ▁ him ▁ day ▁ and ▁ night ▁ in ▁ his ▁ temple . ▁ he ▁ who ▁ sits ▁ on ▁ the ▁ throne ▁ will ▁ spread ▁ his ▁ tabernacle ▁ over ▁ them .
▁ and ▁ jonathan ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ far ▁ be ▁ it ▁ from ▁ thee: ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ die: ▁ behold, ▁ my ▁ father ▁ will ▁ not ▁ do ▁ any ▁ thing ▁ great ▁ or ▁ small ▁ without ▁ discovering ▁ it ▁ to ▁ me; ▁ and ▁ why ▁ should ▁ my ▁ father ▁ hide ▁ this ▁ matter ▁ from ▁ me? ▁ this ▁ thing ▁ is ▁ not ▁ so .
▁ and ▁ a ▁ thousand ▁ men ▁ of ▁ benjamin ▁ were ▁ with ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ siba ▁ the ▁ servant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ saul, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ fifteen ▁ sons ▁ with ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ twenty ▁ servants ▁ with ▁ him: ▁ and ▁ they ▁ went ▁ directly ▁ down ▁ to ▁ jordan ▁ before ▁ the ▁ king,
▁ so ▁ christ ▁ also, ▁ having ▁ been ▁ offered ▁ once ▁ to ▁ bear ▁ the ▁ sins ▁ of ▁ many, ▁ will ▁ appear ▁ a ▁ second ▁ time, ▁ without ▁ sin, ▁ to ▁ those ▁ who ▁ are ▁ eagerly ▁ waiting ▁ for ▁ him ▁ for ▁ salvation .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ ye ▁ be ▁ willing, ▁ and ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ eat ▁ the ▁ good ▁ of ▁ the ▁ land:
▁ and ▁ he ▁ went ▁ through ▁ all ▁ the ▁ tribes ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ to ▁ abel, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ bethmacha; ▁ and ▁ all ▁ in ▁ charri ▁ too ▁ were ▁ assembled, ▁ and ▁ followed ▁ after ▁ him .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ looked ▁ behind ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ saw ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ called ▁ me; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ behold, ▁ here ▁ am ▁ i .
▁ the ▁ elders ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ troubled, ▁ and ▁ pangs ▁ shall ▁ seize ▁ them, ▁ as ▁ of ▁ a ▁ woman ▁ in ▁ travail: ▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ mourn ▁ one ▁ to ▁ another, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ amazed, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ change ▁ their ▁ countenance ▁ as ▁ a ▁ flame .
▁ from ▁ that ▁ city ▁ many ▁ of ▁ the ▁ samaritans ▁ believed ▁ in ▁ him ▁ because ▁ of ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ woman, ▁ who ▁ testified, ▁ 'he ▁ told ▁ me ▁ everything ▁ that ▁ i ▁ did . '
▁ as ▁ winds ▁ and ▁ clouds ▁ and ▁ rains ▁ are ▁ most ▁ evident ▁ objects, ▁ so ▁ is ▁ he ▁ that ▁ boasts ▁ of ▁ a ▁ false ▁ gift .
▁ he ▁ went ▁ forward ▁ a ▁ little, ▁ fell ▁ on ▁ his ▁ face, ▁ and ▁ prayed, ▁ saying, ▁ 'my ▁ father, ▁ if ▁ it ▁ is ▁ possible, ▁ let ▁ this ▁ cup ▁ pass ▁ away ▁ from ▁ me; ▁ nevertheless, ▁ not ▁ what ▁ i ▁ desire, ▁ but ▁ what ▁ you ▁ desire . '
▁ and ▁ they ▁ pitched ▁ a ▁ tent ▁ for ▁ abessalom ▁ on ▁ the ▁ roof, ▁ and ▁ abessalom ▁ went ▁ in ▁ to ▁ his ▁ father's ▁ concubines ▁ in ▁ the ▁ sight ▁ of ▁ all ▁ israel .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ did ▁ so, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ commanded ▁ joshua; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ took ▁ up ▁ twelve ▁ stones ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ jordan, ▁ (as ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ commanded ▁ joshua, ▁ when ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ had ▁ completely ▁ passed ▁ over,) ▁ and ▁ carried ▁ these ▁ stones ▁ with ▁ them ▁ into ▁ the ▁ camp, ▁ and ▁ laid ▁ them ▁ down ▁ there .
▁ he . ▁ he ▁ has ▁ bent ▁ his ▁ bow, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ me ▁ as ▁ a ▁ mark ▁ for ▁ the ▁ arrow .
▁ let ▁ us ▁ therefore ▁ be ▁ prepared ▁ at ▁ any ▁ hour, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ we ▁ may ▁ say ▁ with ▁ boldness, ▁ ' ▁ lord, ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ is ▁ ready, ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ is ▁ ready . ’
▁ and ▁ he ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ wept ▁ as ▁ he ▁ said ▁ it, ▁ 'the ▁ wild ▁ beasts ▁ carried ▁ them ▁ off'; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ told ▁ her ▁ what ▁ had ▁ happened ▁ unto ▁ them ▁ (when ▁ they ▁ were) ▁ with ▁ him .
▁ out ▁ of ▁ all ▁ their ▁ affliction: ▁ not ▁ an ▁ ambassador, ▁ nor ▁ a ▁ messenger, ▁ but ▁ himself ▁ saved ▁ them, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ loved ▁ them ▁ and ▁ spared ▁ them: ▁ he ▁ himself ▁ redeemed ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ took ▁ them ▁ up, ▁ and ▁ lifted ▁ them ▁ up ▁ all ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ old .
▁ but ▁ if ▁ we ▁ are ▁ afflicted, ▁ it ▁ is ▁ for ▁ your ▁ comfort ▁ and ▁ salvation . ▁ if ▁ we ▁ are ▁ comforted, ▁ it ▁ is ▁ for ▁ your ▁ comfort, ▁ which ▁ produces ▁ in ▁ you ▁ the ▁ patient ▁ enduring ▁ of ▁ the ▁ same ▁ sufferings ▁ which ▁ we ▁ also ▁ suffer .
▁ giving ▁ thanks ▁ to ▁ the ▁ father, ▁ who ▁ made ▁ us ▁ fit ▁ to ▁ be ▁ partakers ▁ of ▁ the ▁ inheritance ▁ of ▁ the ▁ saints ▁ in ▁ light;
▁ now ▁ ye ▁ know, ▁ (o ▁ my ▁ beloved,) ▁ that ▁ in ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ of ▁ this ▁ encomium ▁ i ▁ did ▁ not ▁ fail ▁ to ▁ say ▁ that ▁ the ▁ blessed ▁ man ▁ apa ▁ pisentius ▁ was ▁ endowed ▁ with ▁ the ▁ gift ▁ of ▁ the ▁ spirit,
▁ they ▁ have ▁ prepared ▁ snares ▁ for ▁ my ▁ feet, ▁ and ▁ have ▁ bowed ▁ down ▁ my ▁ soul: ▁ they ▁ have ▁ dug ▁ a ▁ pit ▁ before ▁ my ▁ face, ▁ and ▁ fallen ▁ into ▁ it ▁ themselves . ▁ pause .
▁ then ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ arise ▁ and ▁ go ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ place ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ shall ▁ choose, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ come ▁ to ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ the ▁ levites, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ the ▁ judge ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ in ▁ those ▁ days, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ search ▁ out ▁ the ▁ matter ▁ and ▁ report ▁ the ▁ judgment ▁ to ▁ thee .
▁ therefore ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ hosts, ▁ woe ▁ to ▁ the ▁ mighty ▁ men ▁ of ▁ israel; ▁ for ▁ my ▁ wrath ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ cease ▁ against ▁ mine ▁ adversaries, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ execute ▁ judgment ▁ on ▁ mine ▁ enemies .
▁ but ▁ let ▁ us ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ following ▁ commandment ▁ with ▁ which ▁ the ▁ apostle ▁ commanded ▁ us, ▁ saying, ▁ ' ▁ give ▁ ye ▁ unto ▁ every ▁ one ▁ such ▁ things ▁ as ▁ ye ▁ have, ▁ tribute ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ tribute ▁ is ▁ due, ▁ tax ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ tax ▁ is ▁ due, ▁ fear ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ fear ▁ is ▁ due, ▁ honour ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ honour ▁ is ▁ due/
▁ i ▁ know ▁ him, ▁ because ▁ i ▁ am ▁ from ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ sent ▁ me . '
▁ because ▁ of ▁ this ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ light ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ paths ▁ which ▁ were ▁ delicate, ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ make ▁ good ▁ thy ▁ escape, ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ keep ▁ the ▁ faith, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ set ▁ the ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ righteousness ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ head .
▁ when ▁ a ▁ south ▁ wind ▁ blows, ▁ you ▁ say, ▁ 'there ▁ will ▁ be ▁ a ▁ scorching ▁ heat,' ▁ and ▁ it ▁ happens .
▁ therefore ▁ shall ▁ he ▁ lift ▁ up ▁ a ▁ signal ▁ to ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ that ▁ are ▁ afar, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ hiss ▁ for ▁ them ▁ from ▁ the ▁ end ▁ of ▁ the ▁ earth; ▁ and, ▁ behold, ▁ they ▁ are ▁ coming ▁ very ▁ quickly .
▁ who ▁ raised ▁ up ▁ righteousness ▁ from ▁ the ▁ east, ▁ and ▁ called ▁ it ▁ to ▁ his ▁ feet, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ it ▁ should ▁ go? ▁ shall ▁ appoint ▁ it ▁ an ▁ adversary ▁ of ▁ gentiles, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ dismay ▁ kings, ▁ and ▁ bury ▁ their ▁ swords ▁ in ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ cast ▁ forth ▁ their ▁ bows ▁ and ▁ arrows ▁ as ▁ sticks?
▁ and ▁ wherever ▁ thou ▁ diest, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ die, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ will ▁ i ▁ be ▁ buried: ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ do ▁ so ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ more ▁ also, ▁ if ▁ i ▁ leave ▁ thee, ▁ for ▁ death ▁ only ▁ shall ▁ divide ▁ between ▁ me ▁ and ▁ thee .
▁ now ▁ after ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ adam ▁ was ▁ an ▁ hungered, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ could ▁ not ▁ find ▁ food ▁ to ▁ eat ▁ similar ▁ to ▁ that ▁ which ▁ they ▁ were ▁ wont ▁ to ▁ eat ▁ daily ▁ in ▁ paradise .
▁ he ▁ swam ▁ across ▁ the ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ left ▁ on ▁ the ▁ other ▁ side ▁ the ▁ son ▁ whom ▁ he ▁ had ▁ been ▁ carrying,
▁ that ▁ i ▁ may ▁ declare ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ praises ▁ in ▁ the ▁ gates ▁ of ▁ the ▁ daughter ▁ of ▁ sion: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ exult ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ salvation .
▁ but ▁ when ▁ pilate ▁ heard ▁ galilee ▁ mentioned, ▁ he ▁ asked ▁ if ▁ the ▁ man ▁ was ▁ a ▁ galilean .
▁ for ▁ if ▁ we ▁ do ▁ not ▁ judge ▁ they ▁ will ▁ not ▁ judge ▁ us ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ judgement .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ withdraw ▁ thy ▁ mercy ▁ from ▁ my ▁ house ▁ for ▁ ever: ▁ and ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ doest ▁ not, ▁ when ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ cuts ▁ off ▁ the ▁ enemies ▁ of ▁ david ▁ each ▁ from ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ the ▁ earth,
▁ and ▁ aaron ▁ says ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ take ▁ off ▁ the ▁ golden ▁ ear-rings ▁ which ▁ are ▁ in ▁ the ▁ ears ▁ of ▁ your ▁ wives ▁ and ▁ daughters, ▁ and ▁ bring ▁ them ▁ to ▁ me .
▁ even ▁ when ▁ we ▁ were ▁ dead ▁ through ▁ our ▁ trespasses, ▁ made ▁ us ▁ alive ▁ together ▁ with ▁ christ ▁ (by ▁ grace ▁ you ▁ have ▁ been ▁ saved),
▁ has ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ no ▁ power ▁ to ▁ save? ▁ or ▁ has ▁ he ▁ made ▁ his ▁ ear ▁ heavy, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ he ▁ should ▁ not ▁ hear?
▁ consider ▁ isaac, ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ abraham, ▁ who ▁ shewed ▁ no ▁ disobedience ▁ to ▁ his ▁ father ▁ when ▁ he ▁ saw ▁ the ▁ knife ▁ of ▁ slaughter ▁ which ▁ was ▁ to ▁ kill ▁ him ▁ coming ▁ down ▁ upon ▁ him .
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ jews ▁ that ▁ were ▁ in ▁ moab, ▁ and ▁ among ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ ammon, ▁ and ▁ those ▁ that ▁ were ▁ in ▁ idumea, ▁ and ▁ those ▁ that ▁ were ▁ in ▁ all ▁ the ▁ rest ▁ of ▁ the ▁ country, ▁ heard ▁ that ▁ the ▁ king ▁ of ▁ babylon ▁ had ▁ granted ▁ a ▁ remnant ▁ to ▁ juda, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ he ▁ had ▁ appointed ▁ over ▁ them ▁ godolias ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ achicam .
▁ for ▁ he ▁ knows ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ transgressors; ▁ and ▁ when ▁ he ▁ sees ▁ wickedness, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ not ▁ overlook ▁ it .
▁ and ▁ saul ▁ said, ▁ cast ▁ lots ▁ between ▁ me ▁ and ▁ my ▁ son ▁ jonathan: ▁ whomsoever ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ shall ▁ cause ▁ to ▁ be ▁ taken ▁ by ▁ lot, ▁ let ▁ him ▁ die: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ people ▁ said ▁ to ▁ saul, ▁ this ▁ thing ▁ is ▁ not ▁ to ▁ be ▁ done: ▁ and ▁ saul ▁ prevailed ▁ against ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ cast ▁ lots ▁ between ▁ him ▁ and ▁ jonathan ▁ his ▁ son, ▁ and ▁ jonathan ▁ is ▁ taken ▁ by ▁ lot .
▁ i ▁ desired ▁ to ▁ do ▁ thy ▁ will, ▁ o ▁ my ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ law ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ mine ▁ heart .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ the ▁ leprosy ▁ should ▁ have ▁ come ▁ out ▁ very ▁ evidently ▁ in ▁ the ▁ skin, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ leprosy ▁ should ▁ cover ▁ all ▁ the ▁ skin ▁ of ▁ the ▁ patient ▁ from ▁ the ▁ head ▁ to ▁ the ▁ feet, ▁ wheresoever ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ shall ▁ look;
▁ but ▁ he, ▁ beckoning ▁ to ▁ them ▁ with ▁ his ▁ hand ▁ to ▁ be ▁ silent, ▁ declared ▁ to ▁ them ▁ how ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ had ▁ brought ▁ him ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ prison . ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'tell ▁ these ▁ things ▁ to ▁ james, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ the ▁ brothers . ' ▁ then ▁ he ▁ departed, ▁ and ▁ went ▁ to ▁ another ▁ place .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ monk ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ him, ▁ 'whatsoever ▁ pleaseth ▁ thee ▁ that ▁ will ▁ i ▁ do ▁ with ▁ thee,
▁ and ▁ david ▁ departed ▁ thence, ▁ and ▁ escaped; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ comes ▁ to ▁ the ▁ cave ▁ of ▁ odollam, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ brethren ▁ hear, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ his ▁ father, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ go ▁ down ▁ to ▁ him ▁ there .
▁ and ▁ saul ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ why ▁ have ▁ thou ▁ and ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ jessae ▁ conspired ▁ against ▁ me, ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ shouldest ▁ give ▁ him ▁ bread ▁ and ▁ a ▁ sword, ▁ and ▁ shouldest ▁ enquire ▁ of ▁ god ▁ for ▁ him, ▁ to ▁ raise ▁ him ▁ up ▁ against ▁ me ▁ as ▁ an ▁ enemy, ▁ as ▁ he ▁ is ▁ this ▁ day?
▁ especially ▁ because ▁ you ▁ are ▁ expert ▁ in ▁ all ▁ customs ▁ and ▁ questions ▁ which ▁ are ▁ among ▁ the ▁ jews . ▁ therefore ▁ i ▁ beg ▁ you ▁ to ▁ hear ▁ me ▁ patiently .
▁ sorrowing ▁ most ▁ of ▁ all ▁ because ▁ of ▁ the ▁ word ▁ which ▁ he ▁ had ▁ spoken, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ should ▁ see ▁ his ▁ face ▁ no ▁ more . ▁ and ▁ they ▁ accompanied ▁ him ▁ to ▁ the ▁ ship .
▁ mine ▁ enemies ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ turned ▁ back, ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ wherein ▁ i ▁ shall ▁ call ▁ upon ▁ thee; ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ know ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ my ▁ god .
▁ but ▁ many ▁ who ▁ are ▁ first ▁ will ▁ be ▁ last; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ last ▁ first . '
▁ when ▁ they ▁ had ▁ further ▁ threatened ▁ them, ▁ they ▁ let ▁ them ▁ go, ▁ finding ▁ no ▁ way ▁ to ▁ punish ▁ them, ▁ because ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people; ▁ for ▁ everyone ▁ glorified ▁ god ▁ for ▁ that ▁ which ▁ was ▁ done .
▁ because ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ known ▁ of ▁ god ▁ is ▁ revealed ▁ in ▁ them, ▁ for ▁ god ▁ revealed ▁ it ▁ to ▁ them .
▁ and ▁ isaac ▁ said ▁ to ▁ jacob, ▁ draw ▁ night ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ feel ▁ thee, ▁ son, ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ my ▁ son ▁ esau ▁ or ▁ not .
▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ in ▁ which ▁ the ▁ tabernacle ▁ was ▁ pitched ▁ the ▁ cloud ▁ covered ▁ the ▁ tabernacle, ▁ the ▁ place ▁ of ▁ the ▁ testimony; ▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ evening ▁ there ▁ was ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ tabernacle ▁ as ▁ the ▁ appearance ▁ of ▁ fire ▁ till ▁ the ▁ morning .
▁ every ▁ man ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ or ▁ of ▁ the ▁ strangers ▁ abiding ▁ among ▁ you, ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ kill ▁ a ▁ calf, ▁ or ▁ a ▁ sheep, ▁ or ▁ a ▁ goat ▁ in ▁ the ▁ camp, ▁ or ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ kill ▁ it ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ camp,
▁ those ▁ who ▁ ate ▁ were ▁ about ▁ five ▁ thousand ▁ men, ▁ besides ▁ women ▁ and ▁ children .
▁ for ▁ he ▁ wrote ▁ saying, ▁ 'take ▁ unto ▁ you ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ armour ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ helmet ▁ of ▁ the ▁ spirit .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ ran ▁ and ▁ took ▁ him ▁ thence, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ set ▁ him ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ was ▁ higher ▁ than ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people ▁ by ▁ his ▁ shoulders ▁ and ▁ upwards .
▁ they ▁ have ▁ drawn ▁ nigh ▁ who ▁ persecuted ▁ me ▁ unlawfully; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ are ▁ far ▁ removed ▁ from ▁ thy ▁ law .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ basons, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ snuffers, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ oil-funnels, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ candlesticks, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ censers, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ cups, ▁ the ▁ golden, ▁ of ▁ gold, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ silver, ▁ of ▁ silver, ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ guard ▁ took ▁ away .
▁ moses ▁ my ▁ servant ▁ is ▁ dead; ▁ now ▁ then ▁ arise, ▁ go ▁ over ▁ jordan, ▁ thou ▁ and ▁ all ▁ this ▁ people, ▁ into ▁ the ▁ land, ▁ which ▁ i ▁ give ▁ them .
▁ hungry ▁ and ▁ thirsty, ▁ their ▁ soul ▁ fainted ▁ in ▁ them .
▁ is ▁ not ▁ my ▁ inheritance ▁ to ▁ me ▁ a ▁ hyaena's ▁ cave, ▁ or ▁ a ▁ cave ▁ round ▁ about ▁ her? ▁ go ▁ ye, ▁ gather ▁ together ▁ all ▁ the ▁ wild ▁ beasts ▁ of ▁ the ▁ field, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ them ▁ come ▁ to ▁ devour ▁ her .
▁ but ▁ my ▁ feet ▁ were ▁ almost ▁ overthrown; ▁ my ▁ goings ▁ very ▁ nearly ▁ slipped .
▁ wherever ▁ the ▁ cloud ▁ happened ▁ to ▁ be, ▁ there ▁ was ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ ready ▁ to ▁ go: ▁ the ▁ wheels ▁ went ▁ and ▁ were ▁ lifted ▁ up ▁ with ▁ them; ▁ because ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ life ▁ was ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wheels .

▁ and ▁ if ▁ the ▁ man ▁ should ▁ not ▁ be ▁ willing ▁ to ▁ take ▁ his ▁ brother's ▁ wife, ▁ then ▁ shall ▁ the ▁ woman ▁ go ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ gate ▁ to ▁ the ▁ elders, ▁ and ▁ she ▁ shall ▁ say, ▁ my ▁ husband's ▁ brother ▁ will ▁ not ▁ raise ▁ up ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ his ▁ brother ▁ in ▁ israel, ▁ my ▁ husband's ▁ brother ▁ has ▁ refused .

▁ god ▁ is ▁ our ▁ refuge ▁ and ▁ strength, ▁ a ▁ help ▁ in ▁ the ▁ afflictions ▁ that ▁ have ▁ come ▁ heavily ▁ upon ▁ us .
▁ but ▁ if ▁ ye ▁ say, ▁ we ▁ trust ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god;
▁ even ▁ as ▁ you ▁ gave ▁ him ▁ authority ▁ over ▁ all ▁ flesh, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ give ▁ eternal ▁ life ▁ to ▁ all ▁ whom ▁ you ▁ have ▁ given ▁ him .

▁ wherefore ▁ now, ▁ my ▁ son, ▁ consider ▁ what ▁ alms ▁ doeth, ▁ and ▁ how ▁ righteousness ▁ doth ▁ deliver . ▁ when ▁ he ▁ had ▁ said ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ he ▁ gave ▁ up ▁ the ▁ ghost ▁ in ▁ the ▁ bed, ▁ being ▁ an ▁ hundred ▁ and ▁ eight ▁ and ▁ fifty ▁ years ▁ old; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ buried ▁ him ▁ honourably .

▁ the ▁ princes ▁ of ▁ juda, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ men ▁ in ▁ power, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ priests, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ people;
▁ and ▁ confirming ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ his ▁ servant, ▁ and ▁ verifying ▁ the ▁ counsel ▁ of ▁ his ▁ messengers: ▁ who ▁ says ▁ to ▁ jerusalem, ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ be ▁ inhabited; ▁ and ▁ to ▁ the ▁ cities ▁ of ▁ idumea, ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ built, ▁ and ▁ her ▁ desert ▁ places ▁ shall ▁ spring ▁ forth .

▁ he ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ into ▁ their ▁ midst ▁ as ▁ the ▁ land, ▁ as ▁ an ▁ eagle ▁ against ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ because ▁ they ▁ have ▁ transgressed ▁ my ▁ covenant, ▁ and ▁ have ▁ sinned ▁ against ▁ my ▁ law .
▁ the ▁ lips ▁ of ▁ talkers ▁ will ▁ be ▁ telling ▁ such ▁ things ▁ as ▁ pertain ▁ not ▁ unto ▁ them: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ such ▁ as ▁ have ▁ understanding ▁ are ▁ weighed ▁ in ▁ the ▁ balance .
▁ and ▁ whatever ▁ man ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ or ▁ of ▁ the ▁ strangers ▁ abiding ▁ among ▁ you ▁ shall ▁ take ▁ any ▁ animal ▁ in ▁ hunting, ▁ beast, ▁ or ▁ bird, ▁ which ▁ is ▁ eaten, ▁ then ▁ shall ▁ he ▁ pour ▁ out ▁ the ▁ blood, ▁ and ▁ cover ▁ it ▁ in ▁ the ▁ dust .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ sent ▁ heliakim ▁ the ▁ steward, ▁ and ▁ somnas ▁ the ▁ scribe, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ of ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ clothed ▁ with ▁ sackcloth, ▁ to ▁ esaias ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ amos, ▁ the ▁ prophet . ▁ and ▁ they ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ thus ▁ says ▁ ezekias,

▁ and ▁ aaron ▁ said ▁ to ▁ moses, ▁ be ▁ not ▁ angry, ▁ my ▁ lord, ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ knowest ▁ the ▁ impetuosity ▁ of ▁ this ▁ people .

▁ have ▁ i ▁ not ▁ already ▁ commanded ▁ (or, ▁ announced ▁ to) ▁ thee, ▁ saying ▁ i ▁ not ▁ already ▁ commanded ▁ (or, ▁ announced ▁ to) ▁ thee, ▁ saying,
▁ and ▁ they ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ ``verily ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ worthy ▁ of ▁ a ▁ great ▁ reward . ''
▁ if ▁ thou ▁ dost ▁ a ▁ contend ▁ in ▁ patience ▁ in ▁ the ▁ strife ▁ of ▁ the ▁ scriptures, ▁ no ▁ servitude ▁ whatsoever ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ thee, ▁ according ▁ to ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is, ▁ written,
▁ alas, ▁ alas, ▁ alas ▁ for ▁ the ▁ day! ▁ for ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ is ▁ nigh, ▁ and ▁ it ▁ will ▁ come ▁ as ▁ trouble ▁ upon ▁ trouble .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ procures ▁ wisdom ▁ loves ▁ himself; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ that ▁ keeps ▁ wisdom ▁ shall ▁ find ▁ good .
▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ hoped ▁ in ▁ thee: ▁ let ▁ me ▁ never ▁ be ▁ put ▁ to ▁ shame .
▁ for ▁ this ▁ is ▁ the ▁ will ▁ of ▁ god: ▁ your ▁ sanctification, ▁ that ▁ you ▁ abstain ▁ from ▁ sexual ▁ immorality,
▁ had ▁ it ▁ not ▁ been ▁ for ▁ the ▁ emperor ▁ my ▁ father ▁ would ▁ have ▁ cut ▁ off ▁ my ▁ head .
▁ for ▁ thou ▁ wilt ▁ save ▁ the ▁ lowly ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ wilt ▁ humble ▁ the ▁ eyes ▁ of ▁ the ▁ proud .
▁ may ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ reward ▁ him ▁ according ▁ to ▁ what ▁ he ▁ hath ▁ done ▁ unto ▁ me . '
▁ i ▁ have ▁ hated ▁ them ▁ with ▁ perfect ▁ hatred; ▁ they ▁ were ▁ counted ▁ my ▁ enemies .
▁ they ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ him, ▁ 'hail, ▁ good ▁ neighbour!'
▁ but ▁ he ▁ hated ▁ the ▁ vain ▁ approbation ▁ of ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ hid ▁ his ▁ manner ▁ of ▁ life ▁ so ▁ that ▁ no ▁ man ▁ whatsoever ▁ might ▁ attain ▁ to ▁ the ▁ full ▁ knowledge ▁ of ▁ the ▁ same .
▁ then ▁ joshua ▁ called ▁ together ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ ruben, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ gad, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ half ▁ tribe ▁ of ▁ manasse,
▁ thine ▁ eye ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ spare ▁ him: ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ exact ▁ life ▁ for ▁ life, ▁ eye ▁ for ▁ eye, ▁ tooth ▁ for ▁ tooth, ▁ hand ▁ for ▁ hand, ▁ foot ▁ for ▁ foot .
▁ they ▁ have ▁ said ▁ in ▁ their ▁ heart, ▁ even ▁ all ▁ their ▁ kindred ▁ together, ▁ come, ▁ let ▁ us ▁ abolish ▁ the ▁ feasts ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ from ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ horror ▁ and ▁ trembling ▁ seized ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ caused ▁ all ▁ my ▁ bones ▁ greatly ▁ to ▁ shake .
▁ she ▁ gave ▁ birth ▁ to ▁ a ▁ son, ▁ a ▁ male ▁ child, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ to ▁ rule ▁ all ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ with ▁ a ▁ rod ▁ of ▁ iron . ▁ her ▁ child ▁ was ▁ caught ▁ up ▁ to ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ his ▁ throne .
▁ pilate ▁ answered, ▁ 'what ▁ i ▁ have ▁ written, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ written . '
▁ and ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ joseph ▁ answered ▁ joshua, ▁ saying, ▁ wherefore ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ caused ▁ us ▁ to ▁ inherit ▁ one ▁ inheritance, ▁ and ▁ one ▁ line? ▁ whereas ▁ i ▁ am ▁ a ▁ great ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ god ▁ has ▁ blessed ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ job ▁ continued ▁ and ▁ said ▁ in ▁ his ▁ parable,
▁ and ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ the ▁ land ▁ be ▁ troubled ▁ for ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ every ▁ one ▁ who ▁ dwells ▁ in ▁ it ▁ mourn? ▁ whereas ▁ destruction ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ up ▁ as ▁ a ▁ river, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ descend ▁ as ▁ the ▁ river ▁ of ▁ egypt .
▁ the ▁ priests ▁ said ▁ not, ▁ where ▁ is ▁ the ▁ lord? ▁ and ▁ they ▁ that ▁ held ▁ by ▁ the ▁ law ▁ knew ▁ me ▁ not: ▁ the ▁ shepherds ▁ also ▁ sinned ▁ against ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ prophets ▁ prophesied ▁ by ▁ baal, ▁ and ▁ went ▁ after ▁ that ▁ which ▁ profited ▁ not .
▁ they ▁ shall ▁ declare ▁ thine ▁ ordinances ▁ to ▁ jacob, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ law ▁ to ▁ israel: ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ place ▁ incense ▁ in ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ wrath ▁ continually ▁ upon ▁ thine ▁ altar .
▁ that ▁ we ▁ may ▁ buy ▁ the ▁ poor ▁ for ▁ silver, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ needy ▁ for ▁ shoes; ▁ and ▁ we ▁ will ▁ trade ▁ in ▁ every ▁ kind ▁ of ▁ fruit .
▁ then ▁ jesus ▁ came ▁ from ▁ galilee ▁ to ▁ the ▁ jordan ▁ to ▁ john, ▁ to ▁ be ▁ baptized ▁ by ▁ him .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ hath ▁ understanding ▁ shall ▁ speak ▁ out, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ time ▁ is ▁ evil .
▁ for ▁ all ▁ his ▁ judgments ▁ and ▁ his ▁ ordinances ▁ were ▁ before ▁ me: ▁ i ▁ departed ▁ not ▁ from ▁ them .
▁ i ▁ went ▁ forth ▁ to ▁ meet ▁ the ▁ philistine; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ cursed ▁ me ▁ by ▁ his ▁ idols .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ people ▁ shall ▁ dwell ▁ in ▁ sion: ▁ and ▁ whereas ▁ jerusalem ▁ has ▁ wept ▁ bitterly, ▁ saying, ▁ pity ▁ me; ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ pity ▁ thee: ▁ when ▁ he ▁ perceived ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ cry, ▁ he ▁ hearkened ▁ to ▁ thee .
▁ cursed ▁ are ▁ all ▁ they ▁ which ▁ hate ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ blessed ▁ shall ▁ all ▁ be ▁ which ▁ love ▁ thee ▁ for ▁ ever .
▁ they ▁ will ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ 'look, ▁ here!' ▁ or ▁ 'look, ▁ there!' ▁ don't ▁ go ▁ away, ▁ nor ▁ follow ▁ after ▁ them,
▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ by ▁ no ▁ means ▁ get ▁ out ▁ of ▁ there, ▁ until ▁ you ▁ have ▁ paid ▁ the ▁ very ▁ last ▁ penny . '
▁ only ▁ if ▁ the ▁ water ▁ be ▁ of ▁ fountains ▁ of ▁ water, ▁ or ▁ a ▁ pool, ▁ or ▁ confluence ▁ of ▁ water, ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ clean; ▁ but ▁ he ▁ that ▁ touches ▁ their ▁ carcases ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ unclean .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ yet ▁ again ▁ committed ▁ iniquity ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ delivered ▁ them ▁ into ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ phylistines ▁ forty ▁ years .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ borders ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ joseph ▁ were ▁ from ▁ jordan ▁ by ▁ jericho ▁ eastward; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ will ▁ go ▁ up ▁ from ▁ jericho ▁ to ▁ the ▁ hill ▁ country, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ wilderness, ▁ to ▁ baethel ▁ luza .
▁ not ▁ boasting ▁ beyond ▁ proper ▁ limits ▁ in ▁ other ▁ men's ▁ labors, ▁ but ▁ having ▁ hope ▁ that ▁ as ▁ your ▁ faith ▁ grows, ▁ we ▁ will ▁ be ▁ abundantly ▁ enlarged ▁ by ▁ you ▁ in ▁ our ▁ sphere ▁ of ▁ influence,
▁ and ▁ their ▁ tongues ▁ have ▁ set ▁ him ▁ at ▁ nought, ▁ all ▁ that ▁ saw ▁ them ▁ were ▁ troubled;

▁ for ▁ you, ▁ brothers, ▁ were ▁ called ▁ for ▁ freedom . ▁ only ▁ don't ▁ use ▁ your ▁ freedom ▁ for ▁ gain ▁ to ▁ the ▁ flesh, ▁ but ▁ through ▁ love ▁ be ▁ servants ▁ to ▁ one ▁ another .
▁ every ▁ priest ▁ indeed ▁ stands ▁ day ▁ by ▁ day ▁ serving ▁ and ▁ often ▁ offering ▁ the ▁ same ▁ sacrifices, ▁ which ▁ can ▁ never ▁ take ▁ away ▁ sins,
▁ and ▁ jothor ▁ the ▁ father-in-law ▁ of ▁ moses, ▁ took ▁ sepphora ▁ the ▁ wife ▁ of ▁ moses ▁ after ▁ she ▁ had ▁ been ▁ sent ▁ away,
▁ and ▁ the ▁ princes ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ ammon ▁ said ▁ to ▁ annon ▁ their ▁ lord, ▁ is ▁ it ▁ to ▁ honour ▁ thy ▁ father ▁ before ▁ thee ▁ that ▁ david ▁ has ▁ sent ▁ comforters ▁ to ▁ thee? ▁ has ▁ not ▁ david ▁ rather ▁ sent ▁ his ▁ servants ▁ to ▁ thee ▁ that ▁ they ▁ should ▁ search ▁ the ▁ city, ▁ and ▁ spy ▁ it ▁ out ▁ and ▁ examine ▁ it?
▁ and ▁ they ▁ will ▁ kill ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ third ▁ day ▁ he ▁ will ▁ be ▁ raised ▁ up . ' ▁ they ▁ were ▁ exceedingly ▁ sorry .

▁ don't ▁ you ▁ understand ▁ that ▁ whatever ▁ goes ▁ into ▁ the ▁ mouth ▁ passes ▁ into ▁ the ▁ belly, ▁ and ▁ then ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ body?
▁ therefore, ▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ brings ▁ up ▁ upon ▁ you ▁ the ▁ water ▁ of ▁ the ▁ river, ▁ strong ▁ and ▁ abundant, ▁ even ▁ the ▁ king ▁ of ▁ the ▁ assyrians, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ glory: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ up ▁ over ▁ every ▁ valley ▁ of ▁ yours, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ walk ▁ over ▁ every ▁ wall ▁ of ▁ yours:

▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ on ▁ the ▁ third ▁ day, ▁ that, ▁ behold, ▁ a ▁ man ▁ came ▁ from ▁ the ▁ camp, ▁ from ▁ the ▁ people ▁ of ▁ saul, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ garments ▁ were ▁ rent, ▁ and ▁ earth ▁ was ▁ upon ▁ his ▁ head: ▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ when ▁ he ▁ went ▁ in ▁ to ▁ david, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ fell ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ did ▁ obeisance ▁ to ▁ him .
▁ yet ▁ no ▁ one ▁ spoke ▁ openly ▁ of ▁ him ▁ for ▁ fear ▁ of ▁ the ▁ jews .
▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ no, ▁ but ▁ unless ▁ you ▁ repent, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ all ▁ perish ▁ in ▁ the ▁ same ▁ way .
▁ therefore ▁ i ▁ didn't ▁ even ▁ think ▁ myself ▁ worthy ▁ to ▁ come ▁ to ▁ you; ▁ but ▁ say ▁ the ▁ word, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ servant ▁ will ▁ be ▁ healed .

▁ in ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ was ▁ the ▁ word, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ word ▁ was ▁ with ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ word ▁ was ▁ god .
▁ the ▁ snares ▁ of ▁ sinners ▁ entangled ▁ me: ▁ but ▁ i ▁ forgot ▁ not ▁ thy ▁ law .
▁ he ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ nobles ▁ with ▁ him ▁ were ▁ exceedingly ▁ sorry ▁ on ▁ his ▁ account,
▁ for ▁ he ▁ lieth ▁ in ▁ wait, ▁ and ▁ turneth ▁ good ▁ into ▁ evil, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ things ▁ worthy ▁ praise ▁ will ▁ lay ▁ blame ▁ upon ▁ thee .
▁ then ▁ the ▁ mother ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ zebedee ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him ▁ with ▁ her ▁ sons, ▁ kneeling ▁ and ▁ asking ▁ a ▁ certain ▁ thing ▁ of ▁ him .
▁ be ▁ ashamed, ▁ o ▁ sidon: ▁ the ▁ sea ▁ has ▁ said, ▁ yea, ▁ the ▁ strength ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sea ▁ has ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ travailed, ▁ nor ▁ brought ▁ forth, ▁ nor ▁ have ▁ i ▁ brought ▁ up ▁ young ▁ men, ▁ nor ▁ reared ▁ virgins .

▁ and ▁ she ▁ arose, ▁ and ▁ did ▁ reverence ▁ with ▁ her ▁ face ▁ to ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ behold, ▁ thy ▁ servant ▁ is ▁ for ▁ an ▁ handmaid ▁ to ▁ wash ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ servants .
▁ saying ▁ that ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ man ▁ must ▁ be ▁ delivered ▁ up ▁ into ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ sinful ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ be ▁ crucified, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ third ▁ day ▁ rise ▁ again?'
▁ give ▁ thanks ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ for ▁ he ▁ is ▁ good: ▁ for ▁ his ▁ mercy ▁ endures ▁ for ▁ ever .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ got ▁ into ▁ a ▁ boat, ▁ his ▁ disciples ▁ followed ▁ him .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ wearied ▁ with ▁ my ▁ groaning; ▁ i ▁ shall ▁ wash ▁ my ▁ bed ▁ every ▁ night; ▁ i ▁ shall ▁ water ▁ my ▁ couch ▁ with ▁ tears .
▁ they ▁ compassed ▁ me ▁ about ▁ as ▁ bees ▁ do ▁ a ▁ honeycomb, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ burst ▁ into ▁ flame ▁ as ▁ fire ▁ among ▁ thorns: ▁ but ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ i ▁ repulsed ▁ them .

▁ the ▁ baptism ▁ of ▁ john, ▁ was ▁ it ▁ from ▁ heaven, ▁ or ▁ from ▁ men?'
▁ and ▁ when ▁ pisentius ▁ had ▁ concluded ▁ the ▁ reciting ▁ of ▁ the ▁ prophet ▁ jeremiah, ▁ and ▁ had ▁ finished ▁ (his ▁ prayer), ▁ the ▁ two ▁ men ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ and ▁ knocked ▁ at ▁ the ▁ door, ▁ at ▁ the ▁ very ▁ moment ▁ when ▁ he ▁ began ▁ to ▁ (recite) ▁ the ▁ (book ▁ of ▁ the) ▁ prophet ▁ ezekiel .

▁ seeing ▁ peter ▁ and ▁ john ▁ about ▁ to ▁ go ▁ into ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ he ▁ asked ▁ to ▁ receive ▁ gifts ▁ for ▁ the ▁ needy .
▁ remembering ▁ abraam ▁ and ▁ isaac ▁ and ▁ jacob ▁ thy ▁ servants, ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ sworn ▁ by ▁ thyself, ▁ and ▁ hast ▁ spoken ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ saying, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ greatly ▁ multiply ▁ your ▁ seed ▁ as ▁ the ▁ stars ▁ of ▁ heaven ▁ for ▁ multitude, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ this ▁ land ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ spokest ▁ of ▁ to ▁ give ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ possess ▁ it ▁ for ▁ ever .
▁ the ▁ pharisees ▁ heard ▁ the ▁ multitude ▁ murmuring ▁ these ▁ things ▁ concerning ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ chief ▁ priests ▁ and ▁ the ▁ pharisees ▁ sent ▁ officers ▁ to ▁ arrest ▁ him .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ came ▁ into ▁ capernaum, ▁ a ▁ centurion ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ asking ▁ him,

▁ let ▁ every ▁ soul ▁ be ▁ in ▁ subjection ▁ to ▁ the ▁ higher ▁ authorities, ▁ for ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ authority ▁ except ▁ from ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ those ▁ who ▁ exist ▁ are ▁ ordained ▁ by ▁ god .
▁ now ▁ when ▁ they ▁ heard ▁ of ▁ the ▁ resurrection ▁ of ▁ the ▁ dead, ▁ some ▁ mocked; ▁ but ▁ others ▁ said, ▁ 'we ▁ want ▁ to ▁ hear ▁ you ▁ again ▁ concerning ▁ this . '
▁ therefore ▁ in ▁ the ▁ resurrection ▁ whose ▁ wife ▁ of ▁ them ▁ will ▁ she ▁ be? ▁ for ▁ the ▁ seven ▁ had ▁ her ▁ as ▁ a ▁ wife . '
▁ i ▁ was ▁ dumb, ▁ and ▁ humbled ▁ myself, ▁ and ▁ kept ▁ silence ▁ from ▁ good ▁ words; ▁ and ▁ my ▁ grief ▁ was ▁ renewed .
▁ the ▁ sacrifice ▁ of ▁ praise ▁ will ▁ glorify ▁ me: ▁ and ▁ that ▁ is ▁ the ▁ way ▁ wherein ▁ i ▁ will ▁ shew ▁ to ▁ him ▁ the ▁ salvation ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ thou ▁ art ▁ to ▁ take ▁ one ▁ thing, ▁ and ▁ three ▁ are ▁ demanded ▁ from ▁ thee .
▁ and ▁ before ▁ the ▁ words ▁ had ▁ escaped ▁ from ▁ my ▁ mouth ▁ one ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wolves ▁ let ▁ out ▁ a ▁ mighty ▁ cry,
▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ proved ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ known ▁ me .
▁ but ▁ thou, ▁ lord, ▁ knowest ▁ me; ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ proved ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ before ▁ thee; ▁ purify ▁ them ▁ for ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ their ▁ slaughter .
▁ here ▁ beginneth ▁ the ▁ life ▁ of ▁ the ▁ blessed ▁ john, ▁ the ▁ perfect ▁ monk, ▁ whose ▁ parents ▁ made ▁ for ▁ him ▁ a ▁ gospel ▁ of ▁ gold
▁ let ▁ him ▁ not ▁ think ▁ that ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ endure; ▁ for ▁ his ▁ end ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ vanity .
▁ the ▁ lord ▁ is ▁ compassionate, ▁ and ▁ merciful; ▁ long ▁ suffering, ▁ and ▁ abundant ▁ in ▁ mercy .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ still ▁ strong ▁ this ▁ day, ▁ as ▁ when ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ sent ▁ me: ▁ just ▁ so ▁ strong ▁ am ▁ i ▁ now ▁ to ▁ go ▁ out ▁ and ▁ to ▁ come ▁ in ▁ for ▁ war .
▁ these ▁ are ▁ the ▁ miscellaneous ▁ instructions ▁ of ▁ solomon, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ friends ▁ of ▁ ezekias ▁ king ▁ of ▁ judea ▁ copied ▁ out .
▁ a ▁ just ▁ arbitrator ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ his ▁ own ▁ friend; ▁ but ▁ mischief ▁ shall ▁ pursue ▁ sinners; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ way ▁ of ▁ ungodly ▁ men ▁ shall ▁ lead ▁ them ▁ astray .
▁ servants, ▁ be ▁ obedient ▁ to ▁ those ▁ who ▁ according ▁ to ▁ the ▁ flesh ▁ are ▁ your ▁ masters, ▁ with ▁ fear ▁ and ▁ trembling, ▁ in ▁ singleness ▁ of ▁ your ▁ heart, ▁ as ▁ to ▁ christ;
▁ therefore ▁ when ▁ mary ▁ came ▁ to ▁ where ▁ jesus ▁ was, ▁ and ▁ saw ▁ him, ▁ she ▁ fell ▁ down ▁ at ▁ his ▁ feet, ▁ saying ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'lord, ▁ if ▁ you ▁ would ▁ have ▁ been ▁ here, ▁ my ▁ brother ▁ wouldn't ▁ have ▁ died . '
▁ not ▁ many ▁ days ▁ after, ▁ the ▁ younger ▁ son ▁ gathered ▁ all ▁ of ▁ this ▁ together ▁ and ▁ traveled ▁ into ▁ a ▁ far ▁ country . ▁ there ▁ he ▁ wasted ▁ his ▁ property ▁ with ▁ riotous ▁ living .
▁ but ▁ afterwards ▁ it ▁ was ▁ a ▁ brazen ▁ vessel ▁ of ▁ fire ▁ which ▁ actually ▁ appeared ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ which ▁ indicated ▁ that ▁ he ▁ who ▁ will ▁ not ▁ lay ▁ hold ▁ on ▁ the ▁ rod
▁ one ▁ of ▁ them ▁ named ▁ agabus ▁ stood ▁ up, ▁ and ▁ indicated ▁ by ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ that ▁ there ▁ should ▁ be ▁ a ▁ great ▁ famine ▁ all ▁ over ▁ the ▁ world, ▁ which ▁ also ▁ happened ▁ in ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ claudius .
▁ that ▁ it ▁ may ▁ give ▁ unto ▁ thy ▁ head ▁ a ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ graces, ▁ and ▁ may ▁ cover ▁ thee ▁ with ▁ a ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ delight .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ will ▁ by ▁ no ▁ means ▁ reject ▁ the ▁ harmless ▁ man; ▁ but ▁ he ▁ will ▁ not ▁ receive ▁ any ▁ gift ▁ of ▁ the ▁ ungodly .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ went ▁ forth ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ the ▁ king ▁ and ▁ said,
▁ the ▁ ancient ▁ heavens ▁ shall ▁ flow, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ clouds ▁ overshadow ▁ innumerable ▁ mortals: ▁ he ▁ has ▁ fixed ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ cattle, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ know ▁ the ▁ order ▁ of ▁ rest . ▁ yet ▁ by ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things ▁ thy ▁ understanding ▁ is ▁ not ▁ astonished, ▁ neither ▁ is ▁ thy ▁ mind ▁ disturbed ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ body .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ conceals ▁ injuries ▁ seeks ▁ love; ▁ but ▁ he ▁ that ▁ hates ▁ to ▁ hide ▁ them ▁ separates ▁ friends ▁ and ▁ kindred .
▁ i ▁ became ▁ manifest ▁ to ▁ them ▁ that ▁ asked ▁ not ▁ for ▁ me; ▁ i ▁ was ▁ found ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ sought ▁ me ▁ not: ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ here, ▁ to ▁ a ▁ nation, ▁ who ▁ called ▁ not ▁ on ▁ my ▁ name .
▁ and ▁ as ▁ concerneth ▁ the ▁ offence ▁ wherewith ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ charged ▁ her ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ mind, ▁ she ▁ and ▁ the ▁ man ▁ also ▁ are ▁ both ▁ innocent .
▁ 'but ▁ as ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ the ▁ promise ▁ came ▁ close ▁ which ▁ god ▁ had ▁ sworn ▁ to ▁ abraham, ▁ the ▁ people ▁ grew ▁ and ▁ multiplied ▁ in ▁ egypt,

▁ but ▁ every ▁ man ▁ followed ▁ the ▁ imagination ▁ of ▁ his ▁ own ▁ wicked ▁ heart, ▁ to ▁ serve ▁ strange ▁ gods, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ do ▁ evil ▁ in ▁ the ▁ sight ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god .
▁ woe ▁ to ▁ the ▁ apostate ▁ children, ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ framed ▁ counsel, ▁ not ▁ by ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ covenants ▁ not ▁ by ▁ my ▁ spirit, ▁ to ▁ add ▁ sins ▁ to ▁ sins:
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ completely ▁ scatter ▁ them; ▁ in ▁ the ▁ gates ▁ of ▁ my ▁ people ▁ they ▁ are ▁ bereaved ▁ of ▁ children: ▁ they ▁ have ▁ destroyed ▁ my ▁ people ▁ because ▁ of ▁ their ▁ iniquities .
▁ then ▁ shall ▁ they ▁ bring ▁ out ▁ the ▁ damsel ▁ to ▁ the ▁ doors ▁ of ▁ her ▁ father's ▁ house, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ stone ▁ her ▁ with ▁ stones, ▁ and ▁ she ▁ shall ▁ die; ▁ because ▁ she ▁ has ▁ wrought ▁ folly ▁ among ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ to ▁ defile ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ her ▁ father ▁ by ▁ whoring: ▁ so ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ remove ▁ the ▁ evil ▁ one ▁ from ▁ among ▁ you .
▁ and ▁ ye ▁ answered ▁ me ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ the ▁ thing ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ told ▁ us ▁ is ▁ good ▁ to ▁ do .
▁ whoso ▁ honoureth ▁ his ▁ father ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ joy ▁ of ▁ his ▁ own ▁ children; ▁ and ▁ when ▁ he ▁ maketh ▁ his ▁ prayer, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ heard .
▁ for ▁ all ▁ the ▁ gods ▁ of ▁ the ▁ heathen ▁ are ▁ devils: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ made ▁ the ▁ heavens .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ gave ▁ to ▁ the ▁ levites ▁ the ▁ cities ▁ and ▁ their ▁ suburbs, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ commanded ▁ moses, ▁ by ▁ lot .
▁ and ▁ he, ▁ because ▁ of ▁ his ▁ valour, ▁ whereof ▁ he ▁ was ▁ conscious, ▁ and ▁ because ▁ of ▁ his ▁ meeting ▁ with ▁ his ▁ wife ▁ and ▁ sons, ▁ was ▁ filled ▁ to ▁ the ▁ uttermost ▁ with ▁ his ▁ joy .
▁ he ▁ came ▁ to ▁ nazareth, ▁ where ▁ he ▁ had ▁ been ▁ brought ▁ up . ▁ he ▁ entered, ▁ as ▁ was ▁ his ▁ custom, ▁ into ▁ the ▁ synagogue ▁ on ▁ the ▁ sabbath ▁ day, ▁ and ▁ stood ▁ up ▁ to ▁ read .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ day ▁ came, ▁ and ▁ helkana ▁ sacrificed, ▁ and ▁ gave ▁ portions ▁ to ▁ his ▁ wife ▁ phennana ▁ and ▁ her ▁ children .
▁ let ▁ us ▁ come ▁ forth ▁ from ▁ our ▁ habits ▁ which ▁ are ▁ evil, ▁ , ▁ and ▁ remove ▁ ourselves ▁ into ▁ the ▁ city ▁ which ▁ is ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heavens .
▁ 'and ▁ he ▁ cried ▁ out ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ grief ▁ and ▁ in ▁ tribulation ▁ of ▁ heart .
▁ i ▁ was ▁ exalted ▁ like ▁ a ▁ cedar ▁ in ▁ libanus, ▁ and ▁ as ▁ a ▁ cypress ▁ tree ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ mountains ▁ of ▁ hermon .
▁ but ▁ thou ▁ saidst, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ do ▁ thee ▁ good, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ make ▁ thy ▁ seed ▁ as ▁ the ▁ sand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sea, ▁ which ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ numbered ▁ for ▁ multitude .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ hew ▁ down ▁ his ▁ foes ▁ before ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ put ▁ to ▁ flight ▁ those ▁ that ▁ hate ▁ him .
▁ day ▁ to ▁ day ▁ utters ▁ speech, ▁ and ▁ night ▁ to ▁ night ▁ proclaims ▁ knowledge .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ loves ▁ his ▁ life ▁ will ▁ lose ▁ it . ▁ he ▁ who ▁ hates ▁ his ▁ life ▁ in ▁ this ▁ world ▁ will ▁ keep ▁ it ▁ to ▁ eternal ▁ life .
▁ he ▁ helped ▁ them ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ way ▁ of ▁ their ▁ iniquity; ▁ for ▁ they ▁ were ▁ brought ▁ low ▁ because ▁ of ▁ their ▁ iniquities .
▁ even ▁ as ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ man ▁ came ▁ not ▁ to ▁ be ▁ served, ▁ but ▁ to ▁ serve, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ give ▁ his ▁ life ▁ as ▁ a ▁ ransom ▁ for ▁ many . '
▁ to ▁ one ▁ he ▁ gave ▁ five ▁ talents, ▁ to ▁ another ▁ two, ▁ to ▁ another ▁ one; ▁ to ▁ each ▁ according ▁ to ▁ his ▁ own ▁ ability . ▁ then ▁ he ▁ went ▁ on ▁ his ▁ journey .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ flee ▁ to ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ brother,
▁ give ▁ heed, ▁ o ▁ my ▁ people, ▁ to ▁ my ▁ law: ▁ incline ▁ your ▁ ear ▁ to ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ my ▁ mouth .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ was ▁ prevailed ▁ upon ▁ to ▁ preserve ▁ his ▁ people .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ half ▁ of ▁ galaad, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ astaroth, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ edrain, ▁ royal ▁ cities ▁ of ▁ og ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ basan, ▁ moses ▁ gave ▁ to ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ machir ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ manasse, ▁ even ▁ to ▁ the ▁ half-tribe ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ machir ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ manasse, ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ families .
▁ the ▁ commanding ▁ officer ▁ came ▁ and ▁ asked ▁ him, ▁ 'tell ▁ me, ▁ are ▁ you ▁ a ▁ roman?' ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'yes . '
▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ hid ▁ thy ▁ truth ▁ within ▁ my ▁ heart, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ declared ▁ thy ▁ salvation; ▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ hid ▁ thy ▁ mercy ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ truth ▁ from ▁ the ▁ great ▁ congregation .
▁ the ▁ brothers ▁ who ▁ were ▁ at ▁ lystra ▁ and ▁ iconium ▁ gave ▁ a ▁ good ▁ testimony ▁ about ▁ him .
▁ now ▁ this ▁ woman ▁ had, ▁ from ▁ the ▁ very ▁ first, ▁ been ▁ preserved, ▁ even ▁ as ▁ i ▁ have ▁ already ▁ said, ▁ through ▁ the ▁ care ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ from ▁ the ▁ violence ▁ of ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ ship ▁ (and ▁ of ▁ other) ▁ masters .
▁ behold, ▁ there ▁ is ▁ a ▁ certain ▁ camp ▁ very ▁ far ▁ away ▁ in ▁ the ▁ south ▁ which ▁ is ▁ deserted, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ man ▁ living ▁ in ▁ it .
▁ he ▁ entered ▁ and ▁ was ▁ passing ▁ through ▁ jericho .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god: ▁ that ▁ is ▁ my ▁ name: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ give ▁ my ▁ glory ▁ to ▁ another, ▁ nor ▁ my ▁ praises ▁ to ▁ graven ▁ images .
▁ the ▁ twelve ▁ gates ▁ were ▁ twelve ▁ pearls . ▁ each ▁ one ▁ of ▁ the ▁ gates ▁ was ▁ made ▁ of ▁ one ▁ pearl . ▁ the ▁ street ▁ of ▁ the ▁ city ▁ was ▁ pure ▁ gold, ▁ like ▁ transparent ▁ glass .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ ship ▁ was ▁ a ▁ savage ▁ and ▁ brutal ▁ man .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ man ▁ took ▁ great ▁ notice ▁ of ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ remained ▁ silent ▁ to ▁ know ▁ whether ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ had ▁ made ▁ his ▁ way ▁ prosperous ▁ or ▁ not .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ law ▁ commandeth ▁ : ▁ 'if ▁ a ▁ man ▁ lie ▁ with ▁ a ▁ maiden ▁ unto ▁ whom ▁ he ▁ hath ▁ not ▁ been ▁ betrothed, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ take ▁ her ▁ by ▁ force, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ be ▁ [found] ▁ with ▁ her, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ give ▁ fifty ▁ 'crowns' ▁ to ▁ her ▁ [father], ▁ now ▁ fifty ▁ shekels ▁ is ▁ the ▁ proper ▁ price ▁ of ▁ a ▁ virgin,
▁ therefore ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ answered ▁ him, ▁ 'you ▁ hypocrites! ▁ doesn't ▁ each ▁ one ▁ of ▁ you ▁ free ▁ his ▁ ox ▁ or ▁ his ▁ donkey ▁ from ▁ the ▁ stall ▁ on ▁ the ▁ sabbath, ▁ and ▁ lead ▁ him ▁ away ▁ to ▁ water?
▁ and ▁ after ▁ abimelech ▁ thola ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ phua ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ to ▁ save ▁ israel, ▁ being ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ his ▁ father's ▁ brother, ▁ a ▁ man ▁ of ▁ issachar; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ dwelt ▁ in ▁ samir ▁ in ▁ mount ▁ ephraim .
▁ they ▁ have ▁ all ▁ gone ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ way, ▁ they ▁ are ▁ together ▁ become ▁ unprofitable; ▁ there ▁ is ▁ none ▁ that ▁ does ▁ good, ▁ there ▁ is ▁ not ▁ even ▁ one .
▁ and ▁ zabulon ▁ did ▁ not ▁ drive ▁ out ▁ the ▁ inhabitants ▁ of ▁ kedron, ▁ nor ▁ the ▁ inhabitants ▁ of ▁ domana: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ chananite ▁ dwelt ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ became ▁ tributary ▁ to ▁ them .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ left ▁ you ▁ in ▁ order ▁ that ▁ your ▁ fruit ▁ may ▁ be ▁ abiding, ▁ and ▁ may ▁ live ▁ for ▁ ever . '
▁ and ▁ now ▁ behold ▁ the ▁ king ▁ whom ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ chosen; ▁ and ▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ set ▁ a ▁ king ▁ over ▁ you .
▁ again ▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ it ▁ is ▁ easier ▁ for ▁ a ▁ camel ▁ to ▁ go ▁ through ▁ a ▁ needle's ▁ eye, ▁ than ▁ for ▁ a ▁ rich ▁ man ▁ to ▁ enter ▁ into ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ god . '
▁ for ▁ very ▁ right ▁ is ▁ the ▁ word ▁ which ▁ is ▁ written ▁ that ▁ saith, ▁ ' ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ are ▁ seen ▁ are ▁ those ▁ that ▁ are ▁ for ▁ a ▁ time, ▁ whilst ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ are ▁ not ▁ seen ▁ are ▁ those ▁ which ▁ are ▁ for ▁ ever'
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ while ▁ saul ▁ was ▁ speaking ▁ to ▁ the ▁ priest, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ sound ▁ in ▁ the ▁ camp ▁ of ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ continued ▁ to ▁ increase ▁ greatly; ▁ and ▁ saul ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ priest, ▁ withdraw ▁ thy ▁ hands .
▁ for ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ good ▁ tree ▁ that ▁ brings ▁ forth ▁ rotten ▁ fruit; ▁ nor ▁ again ▁ a ▁ rotten ▁ tree ▁ that ▁ brings ▁ forth ▁ good ▁ fruit .
▁ appoint, ▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ a ▁ lawgiver ▁ over ▁ them: ▁ let ▁ the ▁ heathen ▁ know ▁ that ▁ they ▁ are ▁ men . ▁ pause .
▁ 'where ▁ is ▁ he ▁ who ▁ is ▁ born ▁ king ▁ of ▁ the ▁ jews? ▁ for ▁ we ▁ saw ▁ his ▁ star ▁ in ▁ the ▁ east, ▁ and ▁ have ▁ come ▁ to ▁ worship ▁ him . '
▁ for ▁ men ▁ will ▁ be ▁ lovers ▁ of ▁ self, ▁ lovers ▁ of ▁ money, ▁ boastful, ▁ arrogant, ▁ blasphemers, ▁ disobedient ▁ to ▁ parents, ▁ unthankful, ▁ unholy,
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ hear ▁ thee ▁ when ▁ thou ▁ prayest ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ grant ▁ thee ▁ power ▁ to ▁ pay ▁ thy ▁ vows .
▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ commanded ▁ the ▁ scribes ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ saying,
▁ the ▁ grace ▁ of ▁ our ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ be ▁ with ▁ your ▁ spirit, ▁ brothers . ▁ amen .
▁ take ▁ away ▁ my ▁ reproach ▁ which ▁ i ▁ have ▁ feared: ▁ for ▁ thy ▁ judgments ▁ are ▁ good .
▁ god ▁ exalted ▁ him ▁ with ▁ his ▁ right ▁ hand ▁ to ▁ be ▁ a ▁ prince ▁ and ▁ a ▁ savior, ▁ to ▁ give ▁ repentance ▁ to ▁ israel, ▁ and ▁ remission ▁ of ▁ sins .
▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'lord, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ ready ▁ to ▁ go ▁ with ▁ you ▁ both ▁ to ▁ prison ▁ and ▁ to ▁ death!'
▁ lift ▁ up ▁ your ▁ hands ▁ by ▁ night ▁ in ▁ the ▁ sanctuaries, ▁ and ▁ bless ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ say ▁ to ▁ this ▁ people, ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ set ▁ before ▁ you ▁ the ▁ way ▁ of ▁ life, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ way ▁ of ▁ death .
▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ kill, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ heal; ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ pull ▁ down, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ build ▁ up;
▁ and ▁ be ▁ found ▁ in ▁ him, ▁ not ▁ having ▁ a ▁ righteousness ▁ of ▁ my ▁ own, ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ but ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ through ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ christ, ▁ the ▁ righteousness ▁ which ▁ is ▁ from ▁ god ▁ by ▁ faith;
▁ again, ▁ the ▁ next ▁ day, ▁ john ▁ was ▁ standing ▁ with ▁ two ▁ of ▁ his ▁ disciples,
▁ 'i ▁ know ▁ your ▁ works ▁ and ▁ where ▁ you ▁ dwell, ▁ where ▁ satan's ▁ throne ▁ is . ▁ you ▁ hold ▁ firmly ▁ to ▁ my ▁ name, ▁ and ▁ didn't ▁ deny ▁ my ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ antipas ▁ my ▁ witness, ▁ my ▁ faithful ▁ one, ▁ who ▁ was ▁ killed ▁ among ▁ you, ▁ where ▁ satan ▁ dwells .
▁ devise ▁ not ▁ a ▁ lie ▁ against ▁ thy ▁ brother; ▁ neither ▁ do ▁ the ▁ like ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ friend .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ spoke ▁ with ▁ me ▁ had ▁ for ▁ a ▁ measure, ▁ a ▁ golden ▁ reed, ▁ to ▁ measure ▁ the ▁ city, ▁ its ▁ gates, ▁ and ▁ its ▁ walls .
▁ as ▁ they ▁ went ▁ out ▁ from ▁ jericho, ▁ a ▁ great ▁ multitude ▁ followed ▁ him .
▁ mine ▁ eye ▁ shall ▁ prey ▁ upon ▁ my ▁ soul, ▁ because ▁ of ▁ all ▁ the ▁ daughters ▁ of ▁ the ▁ city .
▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ exultation ▁ and ▁ salvation ▁ is ▁ in ▁ the ▁ tabernacles ▁ of ▁ the ▁ righteous: ▁ the ▁ right ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ wrought ▁ mightily .
▁ as ▁ for ▁ this ▁ tower ▁ wherein ▁ thou ▁ dwellest, ▁ the ▁ multitudes ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ thereto ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ destroy ▁ it, ▁ (the ▁ story ▁ of) ▁ thy ▁ life ▁ and ▁ conversation ▁ and ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ great ▁ valour ▁ shall ▁ reach ▁ the ▁ uttermost ▁ ends ▁ of ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ diligently ▁ sought ▁ the ▁ goat ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sin-offering, ▁ but ▁ it ▁ had ▁ been ▁ consumed ▁ by ▁ fire; ▁ and ▁ moses ▁ was ▁ angry ▁ with ▁ eleazar ▁ and ▁ ithamar ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ aaron ▁ that ▁ were ▁ left, ▁ saying,
▁ and ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ wilt ▁ not ▁ let ▁ my ▁ people ▁ go, ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ send ▁ upon ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ servants, ▁ and ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ upon ▁ your ▁ houses, ▁ the ▁ dog-fly; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ houses ▁ of ▁ the ▁ egyptians ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ filled ▁ with ▁ the ▁ dog-fly, ▁ even ▁ throughout ▁ the ▁ land ▁ upon ▁ which ▁ they ▁ are .
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ gave ▁ the ▁ land ▁ to ▁ the ▁ tribe ▁ of ▁ ruben ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ families .
▁ but ▁ grant ▁ me ▁ two ▁ things: ▁ then ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ hide ▁ myself ▁ from ▁ thy ▁ face .
▁ for ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ partiality ▁ with ▁ god .
▁ his ▁ parents ▁ answered ▁ them, ▁ 'we ▁ know ▁ that ▁ this ▁ is ▁ our ▁ son, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ born ▁ blind;
▁ and ▁ we ▁ said ▁ to ▁ lord, ▁ the ▁ child ▁ will ▁ not ▁ be ▁ able ▁ to ▁ leave ▁ his ▁ father; ▁ but ▁ if ▁ he ▁ should ▁ leave ▁ his ▁ father, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ die .

▁ thy ▁ hands ▁ have ▁ made ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ fashioned ▁ me: ▁ instruct ▁ me, ▁ that ▁ i ▁ may ▁ learn ▁ thy ▁ commandments .
▁ but ▁ do ▁ thou ▁ wash, ▁ and ▁ anoint ▁ thyself, ▁ and ▁ put ▁ thy ▁ raiment ▁ upon ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ go ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ threshing-floor: ▁ do ▁ not ▁ discover ▁ thyself ▁ to ▁ the ▁ man ▁ until ▁ he ▁ has ▁ done ▁ eating ▁ and ▁ drinking .
▁ others ▁ were ▁ saying, ▁ 'it ▁ is ▁ he . ' ▁ still ▁ others ▁ were ▁ saying, ▁ 'he ▁ looks ▁ like ▁ him . ' ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ 'i ▁ am ▁ he . '
▁ and ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ joseph, ▁ they ▁ also ▁ went ▁ up ▁ to ▁ baethel; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ was ▁ with ▁ them .
▁ a ▁ nation ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ knowest ▁ not ▁ shall ▁ eat ▁ the ▁ produce ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ land, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ labours; ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ be ▁ injured ▁ and ▁ crushed ▁ always .

▁ he ▁ shall ▁ set ▁ his ▁ children ▁ under ▁ her ▁ shelter, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ lodge ▁ under ▁ her ▁ branches .
▁ but ▁ the ▁ wealth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ ungodly ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ as ▁ dust ▁ from ▁ a ▁ wheel, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ multitude ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ oppress ▁ thee ▁ as ▁ flying ▁ chaff, ▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ suddenly ▁ as ▁ a ▁ moment,
▁ a ▁ desirable ▁ treasure ▁ will ▁ rest ▁ on ▁ the ▁ mouth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wise; ▁ but ▁ foolish ▁ men ▁ will ▁ swallow ▁ it ▁ up .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ grace ▁ of ▁ god ▁ has ▁ appeared, ▁ bringing ▁ salvation ▁ to ▁ all ▁ men,
▁ and ▁ now ▁ may ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ deal ▁ in ▁ mercy ▁ and ▁ truth ▁ towards ▁ you: ▁ and ▁ i ▁ also ▁ will ▁ requite ▁ towards ▁ you ▁ this ▁ good ▁ deed, ▁ because ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ done ▁ this .
▁ but ▁ those ▁ who ▁ escorted ▁ paul ▁ brought ▁ him ▁ as ▁ far ▁ as ▁ athens . ▁ receiving ▁ a ▁ commandment ▁ to ▁ silas ▁ and ▁ timothy ▁ that ▁ they ▁ should ▁ come ▁ to ▁ him ▁ very ▁ quickly, ▁ they ▁ departed .
▁ and ▁ anchus ▁ said ▁ to ▁ his ▁ servants, ▁ lo! ▁ ye ▁ see ▁ the ▁ man ▁ is ▁ mad: ▁ why ▁ have ▁ ye ▁ brought ▁ him ▁ in ▁ to ▁ me?
▁ when ▁ gluttony ▁ increaseth, ▁ fornication ▁ reigneth ▁ through ▁ the ▁ drinking ▁ of ▁ the ▁ body, ▁ (and) ▁ pride ▁ hath ▁ rule, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ novices ▁ cease ▁ to ▁ listen ▁ to ▁ the ▁ elders, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ cease ▁ to ▁ trouble ▁ in ▁ any ▁ way ▁ about ▁ the ▁ novices, ▁ and ▁ each ▁ one ▁ walketh ▁ according ▁ to ▁ the ▁ desire ▁ of ▁ his ▁ own ▁ heart .
▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ eat ▁ of ▁ their ▁ flesh, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ touch ▁ their ▁ carcases; ▁ these ▁ are ▁ unclean ▁ to ▁ you .
▁ yet ▁ ye ▁ would ▁ not ▁ go ▁ up, ▁ but ▁ rebelled ▁ against ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god .
▁ there ▁ is ▁ one ▁ that ▁ laboureth, ▁ and ▁ taketh ▁ pains, ▁ and ▁ maketh ▁ haste, ▁ and ▁ is ▁ so ▁ much ▁ the ▁ more ▁ behind .
▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ that ▁ prophet, ▁ or ▁ the ▁ dreamer ▁ of ▁ that ▁ dream, ▁ because ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ tries ▁ you, ▁ to ▁ know ▁ whether ▁ ye ▁ love ▁ your ▁ god ▁ with ▁ all ▁ your ▁ heart ▁ and ▁ with ▁ all ▁ your ▁ soul .
▁ what ▁ then ▁ is ▁ the ▁ law? ▁ it ▁ was ▁ added ▁ because ▁ of ▁ transgressions, ▁ until ▁ the ▁ seed ▁ should ▁ come ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ the ▁ promise ▁ has ▁ been ▁ made . ▁ it ▁ was ▁ ordained ▁ through ▁ angels ▁ by ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ a ▁ mediator .
▁ miserable ▁ are ▁ they ▁ that ▁ afflicted ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ rejoiced ▁ at ▁ thy ▁ fall .
▁ on ▁ the ▁ fifth ▁ day ▁ of ▁ the ▁ month; ▁ this ▁ was ▁ the ▁ fifth ▁ year ▁ of ▁ the ▁ captivity ▁ of ▁ king ▁ joakim .
▁ he ▁ looked ▁ around ▁ at ▁ them ▁ all, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ man, ▁ 'stretch ▁ out ▁ your ▁ hand . ' ▁ he ▁ did, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ hand ▁ was ▁ restored ▁ as ▁ sound ▁ as ▁ the ▁ other .
▁ there ▁ is ▁ this ▁ evil ▁ in ▁ all ▁ that ▁ is ▁ done ▁ under ▁ the ▁ sun, ▁ that ▁ there ▁ is ▁ one ▁ event ▁ to ▁ all: ▁ yea, ▁ the ▁ heart ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ men ▁ is ▁ filled ▁ with ▁ evil, ▁ and ▁ madness ▁ is ▁ in ▁ their ▁ heart ▁ during ▁ their ▁ life, ▁ and ▁ after ▁ that ▁ they ▁ go ▁ to ▁ the ▁ dead .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ am ▁ afraid ▁ that ▁ somehow, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ serpent ▁ deceived ▁ eve ▁ in ▁ his ▁ craftiness, ▁ so ▁ your ▁ minds ▁ might ▁ be ▁ corrupted ▁ from ▁ the ▁ simplicity ▁ that ▁ is ▁ in ▁ christ .
▁ so ▁ david ▁ swore ▁ to ▁ saul: ▁ and ▁ saul ▁ departed ▁ to ▁ his ▁ place, ▁ and ▁ david ▁ and ▁ his ▁ men ▁ went ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ strong-hold ▁ of ▁ messera .

▁ i ▁ waited ▁ patiently ▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ attended ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ hearkened ▁ to ▁ my ▁ supplication .
▁ then ▁ they ▁ cried ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ their ▁ affliction, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ saved ▁ them ▁ out ▁ of ▁ their ▁ distresses .
▁ for ▁ you ▁ bear ▁ with ▁ the ▁ foolish ▁ gladly, ▁ being ▁ wise .

▁ amen .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ said ▁ to ▁ moses, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ also ▁ do ▁ for ▁ thee ▁ this ▁ thing, ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ spoken; ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ found ▁ grace ▁ before ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ know ▁ thee ▁ above ▁ all .

▁ even ▁ as ▁ those ▁ who ▁ from ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ were ▁ eyewitnesses ▁ and ▁ servants ▁ of ▁ the ▁ word ▁ delivered ▁ them ▁ to ▁ us,
▁ an ▁ eloquent ▁ man ▁ is ▁ known ▁ far ▁ and ▁ near; ▁ but ▁ a ▁ man ▁ of ▁ understanding ▁ knoweth ▁ when ▁ he ▁ slippeth .

▁ for ▁ most ▁ certainly ▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you ▁ that ▁ many ▁ prophets ▁ and ▁ righteous ▁ men ▁ desired ▁ to ▁ see ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ you ▁ see, ▁ and ▁ didn't ▁ see ▁ them; ▁ and ▁ to ▁ hear ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ you ▁ hear, ▁ and ▁ didn't ▁ hear ▁ them .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ turns ▁ away ▁ his ▁ ear ▁ from ▁ hearing ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ even ▁ he ▁ has ▁ made ▁ his ▁ prayer ▁ abominable .
▁ o ▁ ever ▁ living ▁ lord! ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ made ▁ the ▁ heaven ▁ and ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ by ▁ thy ▁ great ▁ power, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ thy ▁ high ▁ and ▁ lofty ▁ arm: ▁ nothing ▁ can ▁ be ▁ hidden ▁ from ▁ thee .
▁ there ▁ will ▁ i ▁ cause ▁ to ▁ spring ▁ up ▁ a ▁ horn ▁ to ▁ david: ▁ i ▁ have ▁ prepared ▁ a ▁ lamp ▁ for ▁ mine ▁ anointed .
▁ for ▁ they ▁ and ▁ their ▁ stock ▁ came ▁ up, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ tents ▁ were ▁ with ▁ them, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ locust ▁ in ▁ multitude, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ no ▁ number ▁ to ▁ them ▁ and ▁ their ▁ camels; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ came ▁ to ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ and ▁ laid ▁ it ▁ waste .

▁ paul, ▁ silvanus, ▁ and ▁ timothy, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ assembly ▁ of ▁ the ▁ thessalonians ▁ in ▁ god ▁ the ▁ father ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ: ▁ grace ▁ to ▁ you ▁ and ▁ peace ▁ from ▁ god ▁ our ▁ father ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ .

▁ one ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'behold, ▁ your ▁ mother ▁ and ▁ your ▁ brothers ▁ stand ▁ outside, ▁ seeking ▁ to ▁ speak ▁ to ▁ you . '
▁ that ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ jesus ▁ might ▁ be ▁ fulfilled, ▁ which ▁ he ▁ spoke, ▁ signifying ▁ by ▁ what ▁ kind ▁ of ▁ death ▁ he ▁ should ▁ die .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ slights ▁ a ▁ matter ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ slighted ▁ of ▁ it: ▁ but ▁ he ▁ that ▁ fears ▁ the ▁ commandment ▁ has ▁ health ▁ of ▁ soul . ▁ to ▁ a ▁ crafty ▁ son ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ nothing ▁ good: ▁ but ▁ a ▁ wise ▁ servant ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ prosperous ▁ doings, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ way ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ directed ▁ aright .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ said, ▁ judas ▁ shall ▁ go ▁ up: ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ delivered ▁ the ▁ land ▁ into ▁ his ▁ hand .

▁ o ▁ god, ▁ when ▁ thou ▁ wentest ▁ forth ▁ before ▁ thy ▁ people, ▁ when ▁ thou ▁ wentest ▁ through ▁ the ▁ wilderness; ▁ pause:
▁ be ▁ ye ▁ gathered ▁ and ▁ closely ▁ joined ▁ together, ▁ o ▁ unchastened ▁ nation;
▁ how ▁ are ▁ thy ▁ cheeks ▁ beautiful ▁ as ▁ those ▁ of ▁ a ▁ dove, ▁ thy ▁ neck ▁ as ▁ chains!
▁ so ▁ when ▁ the ▁ samaritans ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ they ▁ begged ▁ him ▁ to ▁ stay ▁ with ▁ them . ▁ he ▁ stayed ▁ there ▁ two ▁ days .

▁ having ▁ assembled ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ the ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ women, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ children, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ stranger ▁ that ▁ is ▁ in ▁ your ▁ cities, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ hear, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ learn ▁ to ▁ fear ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ your ▁ god; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ do ▁ all ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ this ▁ law .

▁ but ▁ if ▁ it ▁ is ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ not ▁ be ▁ able ▁ to ▁ overthrow ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ you ▁ would ▁ be ▁ found ▁ even ▁ to ▁ be ▁ fighting ▁ against ▁ god!'
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ serve ▁ thine ▁ enemies, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ will ▁ send ▁ forth ▁ against ▁ thee, ▁ in ▁ hunger, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ thirst, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ nakedness, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ want ▁ of ▁ all ▁ things; ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ wear ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ neck ▁ a ▁ yoke ▁ of ▁ iron ▁ until ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ destroyed ▁ thee .

▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ and ▁ all ▁ israel ▁ returned ▁ to ▁ dabir; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ encamped ▁ about ▁ it;
▁ honour ▁ and ▁ shame ▁ is ▁ in ▁ talk: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ tongue ▁ of ▁ man ▁ is ▁ his ▁ fall .
▁ always ▁ learning, ▁ and ▁ never ▁ able ▁ to ▁ come ▁ to ▁ the ▁ knowledge ▁ of ▁ the ▁ truth .
▁ but ▁ paul ▁ and ▁ barnabas ▁ stayed ▁ in ▁ antioch, ▁ teaching ▁ and ▁ preaching ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ with ▁ many ▁ others ▁ also .
▁ even ▁ as ▁ david ▁ also ▁ pronounces ▁ blessing ▁ on ▁ the ▁ man ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ god ▁ counts ▁ righteousness ▁ apart ▁ from ▁ works,
▁ and ▁ if ▁ we ▁ know ▁ that ▁ he ▁ listens ▁ to ▁ us, ▁ whatever ▁ we ▁ ask, ▁ we ▁ know ▁ that ▁ we ▁ have ▁ the ▁ petitions ▁ which ▁ we ▁ have ▁ asked ▁ of ▁ him .
▁ hear ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ o ▁ house ▁ of ▁ jacob, ▁ and ▁ every ▁ family ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ israel .

▁ and ▁ return ▁ from ▁ their ▁ stiff ▁ neck, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ their ▁ wicked ▁ deeds: ▁ for ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ remember ▁ the ▁ way ▁ of ▁ their ▁ fathers, ▁ which ▁ sinned ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ sisara ▁ fled ▁ on ▁ his ▁ feet ▁ to ▁ the ▁ tent ▁ of ▁ jael ▁ the ▁ wife ▁ of ▁ chaber ▁ the ▁ kenite ▁ his ▁ friend: ▁ for ▁ there ▁ was ▁ peace ▁ between ▁ jabin ▁ king ▁ of ▁ asor ▁ and ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ chaber ▁ the ▁ kenite .
▁ when ▁ we ▁ entered ▁ into ▁ rome, ▁ the ▁ centurion ▁ delivered ▁ the ▁ prisoners ▁ to ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ guard, ▁ but ▁ paul ▁ was ▁ allowed ▁ to ▁ stay ▁ by ▁ himself ▁ with ▁ the ▁ soldier ▁ who ▁ guarded ▁ him .
▁ therefore, ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ cause ▁ her ▁ to ▁ err, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ make ▁ her ▁ as ▁ desolate, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ speak ▁ comfortably ▁ to ▁ her .

▁ test ▁ your ▁ own ▁ selves, ▁ whether ▁ you ▁ are ▁ in ▁ the ▁ faith . ▁ test ▁ your ▁ own ▁ selves . ▁ or ▁ don't ▁ you ▁ know ▁ as ▁ to ▁ your ▁ own ▁ selves, ▁ that ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ is ▁ in ▁ you?--unless ▁ indeed ▁ you ▁ are ▁ disqualified .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ hastens ▁ as ▁ a ▁ bird ▁ into ▁ a ▁ snare, ▁ not ▁ knowing ▁ that ▁ he ▁ is ▁ running ▁ for ▁ his ▁ life .
▁ i ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ well-pleasing ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ the ▁ living .

▁ he ▁ who ▁ says ▁ he ▁ remains ▁ in ▁ him ▁ ought ▁ himself ▁ also ▁ to ▁ walk ▁ just ▁ like ▁ he ▁ walked .

▁ one ▁ came ▁ and ▁ told ▁ them, ▁ 'behold, ▁ the ▁ men ▁ whom ▁ you ▁ put ▁ in ▁ prison ▁ are ▁ in ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ standing ▁ and ▁ teaching ▁ the ▁ people . '

▁ and ▁ their ▁ word ▁ will ▁ consume ▁ like ▁ gangrene, ▁ of ▁ whom ▁ is ▁ hymenaeus ▁ and ▁ philetus;

▁ to ▁ whom ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ given ▁ counsel? ▁ is ▁ it ▁ not ▁ to ▁ him ▁ who ▁ has ▁ all ▁ wisdom? ▁ whom ▁ wilt ▁ thou ▁ follow? ▁ is ▁ it ▁ not ▁ one ▁ who ▁ has ▁ the ▁ greatest ▁ power?
▁ after ▁ the ▁ uproar ▁ had ▁ ceased, ▁ paul ▁ sent ▁ for ▁ the ▁ disciples, ▁ took ▁ leave ▁ of ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ departed ▁ to ▁ go ▁ into ▁ macedonia .
▁ o ▁ my ▁ son, ▁ take ▁ thou ▁ good ▁ heed ▁ to ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wise ▁ man ▁ paul, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ that ▁ which ▁ he ▁ spake, ▁ saying, ▁ 'there ▁ are ▁ bonds ▁ and ▁ tribulations ▁ awaiting ▁ me ▁ in ▁ jerusalem,
▁ my ▁ god; ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ to ▁ me ▁ my ▁ guard, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ trust ▁ in ▁ him: ▁ he ▁ is ▁ my ▁ protector, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ horn ▁ of ▁ my ▁ salvation, ▁ my ▁ helper, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ sure ▁ refuge; ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ save ▁ me ▁ from ▁ the ▁ unjust ▁ man .
▁ but ▁ he ▁ answered ▁ them, ▁ 'an ▁ evil ▁ and ▁ adulterous ▁ generation ▁ seeks ▁ after ▁ a ▁ sign, ▁ but ▁ no ▁ sign ▁ will ▁ be ▁ given ▁ it ▁ but ▁ the ▁ sign ▁ of ▁ jonah ▁ the ▁ prophet .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ certainly ▁ increase ▁ and ▁ multiply, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ fill ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ become ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thereof . '
▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ servants ▁ shall ▁ dwell ▁ securely, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ seed ▁ shall ▁ prosper ▁ for ▁ ever .
▁ until ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ you ▁ from ▁ on ▁ high, ▁ and ▁ chermel ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ desert, ▁ and ▁ chermel ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ counted ▁ for ▁ a ▁ forest .
▁ who ▁ gave ▁ himself ▁ for ▁ us, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ redeem ▁ us ▁ from ▁ all ▁ iniquity, ▁ and ▁ purify ▁ for ▁ himself ▁ a ▁ people ▁ for ▁ his ▁ own ▁ possession, ▁ zealous ▁ for ▁ good ▁ works .
▁ the ▁ sound ▁ of ▁ a ▁ trumpet, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ words; ▁ which ▁ those ▁ who ▁ heard ▁ it ▁ begged ▁ that ▁ not ▁ one ▁ more ▁ word ▁ should ▁ be ▁ spoken ▁ to ▁ them,
▁ and ▁ the ▁ men ▁ of ▁ the ▁ city ▁ went ▁ out, ▁ and ▁ fought ▁ with ▁ joab: ▁ and ▁ some ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people ▁ of ▁ the ▁ servants ▁ of ▁ david ▁ fell, ▁ and ▁ urias ▁ the ▁ chettite ▁ died ▁ also .
▁ a ▁ talkative ▁ man ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ prosper ▁ on ▁ the ▁ earth: ▁ evils ▁ shall ▁ hunt ▁ the ▁ unrighteous ▁ man ▁ to ▁ destruction .
▁ who ▁ have ▁ sharpened ▁ their ▁ tongues ▁ as ▁ a ▁ sword; ▁ they ▁ have ▁ bent ▁ their ▁ bow ▁ maliciously;
▁ he ▁ that ▁ chastises ▁ the ▁ heathen, ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ he ▁ punish, ▁ even ▁ he ▁ that ▁ teaches ▁ man ▁ knowledge?
▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ against ▁ the ▁ philistines;
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ redeem ▁ israel ▁ from ▁ all ▁ his ▁ iniquities .
▁ i ▁ will ▁ exult ▁ and ▁ be ▁ glad ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ mercy: ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ looked ▁ upon ▁ mine ▁ affliction; ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ saved ▁ my ▁ soul ▁ from ▁ distresses .
▁ they ▁ took ▁ counsel ▁ together ▁ that ▁ they ▁ might ▁ take ▁ jesus ▁ by ▁ deceit, ▁ and ▁ kill ▁ him .
▁ for ▁ we ▁ are ▁ his ▁ workmanship, ▁ created ▁ in ▁ christ ▁ jesus ▁ for ▁ good ▁ works, ▁ which ▁ god ▁ prepared ▁ before ▁ that ▁ we ▁ would ▁ walk ▁ in ▁ them .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ multiply ▁ to ▁ himself ▁ wives, ▁ lest ▁ his ▁ heart ▁ turn ▁ away; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ greatly ▁ multiply ▁ to ▁ himself ▁ silver ▁ and ▁ gold .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ cherubim, ▁ ‘hearken, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ inform ▁ thee ▁ concerning ▁ everything .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass, ▁ when ▁ they ▁ had ▁ finished ▁ eating ▁ the ▁ corn ▁ which ▁ they ▁ had ▁ brought ▁ out ▁ of ▁ egypt, ▁ that ▁ their ▁ father ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ go ▁ again; ▁ buy ▁ us ▁ a ▁ little ▁ food .
▁ i ▁ have ▁ been ▁ crucified ▁ with ▁ christ, ▁ and ▁ it ▁ is ▁ no ▁ longer ▁ i ▁ that ▁ live, ▁ but ▁ christ ▁ living ▁ in ▁ me . ▁ that ▁ life ▁ which ▁ i ▁ now ▁ live ▁ in ▁ the ▁ flesh, ▁ i ▁ live ▁ by ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ who ▁ loved ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ gave ▁ himself ▁ up ▁ for ▁ me .
▁ for ▁ forty ▁ days, ▁ being ▁ tempted ▁ by ▁ the ▁ devil . ▁ he ▁ ate ▁ nothing ▁ in ▁ those ▁ days . ▁ afterward, ▁ when ▁ they ▁ were ▁ completed, ▁ he ▁ was ▁ hungry .
▁ water ▁ flowed ▁ over ▁ my ▁ head: ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ cut ▁ off .
▁ if ▁ i ▁ should ▁ spread ▁ my ▁ wings ▁ to ▁ fly ▁ straight ▁ forward, ▁ and ▁ sojourn ▁ at ▁ the ▁ extremity ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sea, ▁ it ▁ would ▁ be ▁ vain,
▁ and ▁ apa ▁ victor ▁ passed ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ night ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lower ▁ part ▁ of ▁ the ▁ boat, ▁ blessing ▁ god ▁ and ▁ saying,
▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ now ▁ then ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ as ▁ ye ▁ say; ▁ with ▁ whomsoever ▁ the ▁ cup ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ found, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ my ▁ servant, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ clear .
▁ they ▁ understood ▁ none ▁ of ▁ these ▁ things . ▁ this ▁ saying ▁ was ▁ hidden ▁ from ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ didn't ▁ understand ▁ the ▁ things ▁ that ▁ were ▁ said .
▁ the ▁ word ▁ which ▁ jeremias ▁ the ▁ prophet ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ baruch ▁ son ▁ of ▁ nerias, ▁ when ▁ he ▁ wrote ▁ these ▁ words ▁ in ▁ the ▁ book ▁ from ▁ the ▁ mouth ▁ of ▁ jeremias, ▁ in ▁ the ▁ fourth ▁ year ▁ of ▁ joakim ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ josias ▁ king ▁ of ▁ juda .
▁ and ▁ now, ▁ israel, ▁ what ▁ does ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ require ▁ of ▁ thee, ▁ but ▁ to ▁ fear ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ walk ▁ in ▁ all ▁ his ▁ ways, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ love ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ serve ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ with ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ heart, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ soul;
▁ but ▁ he ▁ who ▁ does ▁ wrong ▁ will ▁ receive ▁ again ▁ for ▁ the ▁ wrong ▁ that ▁ he ▁ has ▁ done, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ partiality .
▁ i ▁ will ▁ expand ▁ and ▁ cheer ▁ with ▁ wine ▁ the ▁ soul ▁ of ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ levi, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ people ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ satisfied ▁ with ▁ my ▁ good ▁ things: ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ but ▁ thou ▁ hadst ▁ only ▁ to ▁ wait ▁ for ▁ the ▁ decision ▁ of ▁ the ▁ governor .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ that ▁ if ▁ ye ▁ will ▁ indeed ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ all ▁ these ▁ commands, ▁ which ▁ i ▁ charge ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ observe ▁ this ▁ day, ▁ to ▁ love ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ walk ▁ in ▁ all ▁ his ▁ ways, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ cleave ▁ close ▁ to ▁ him;
▁ and ▁ the ▁ heron, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ swan, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ stork,
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ him ▁ when ▁ he ▁ is ▁ weary ▁ and ▁ weak-handed, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ strike ▁ him ▁ with ▁ terror; ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people ▁ with ▁ him ▁ shall ▁ flee, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ smite ▁ the ▁ king ▁ only ▁ of ▁ all .
▁ as ▁ he ▁ that ▁ lays ▁ hold ▁ of ▁ a ▁ dog's ▁ tail, ▁ so ▁ is ▁ he ▁ that ▁ makes ▁ himself ▁ the ▁ champion ▁ of ▁ another's ▁ cause .
▁ but ▁ they ▁ said, ▁ 'not ▁ during ▁ the ▁ feast, ▁ lest ▁ a ▁ riot ▁ occur ▁ among ▁ the ▁ people . '
▁ and ▁ they ▁ rise ▁ early ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ worship ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ go ▁ their ▁ way: ▁ and ▁ helkana ▁ went ▁ into ▁ his ▁ house ▁ at ▁ armathaim, ▁ and ▁ knew ▁ his ▁ wife ▁ anna; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ remembered ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ she ▁ conceived .
▁ so ▁ long ▁ as ▁ the ▁ simple ▁ cleave ▁ to ▁ justice, ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ ashamed: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ foolish ▁ being ▁ lovers ▁ of ▁ haughtiness, ▁ having ▁ become ▁ ungodly ▁ have ▁ hated ▁ knowledge, ▁ and ▁ are ▁ become ▁ subject ▁ to ▁ reproofs .
▁ but ▁ as ▁ it ▁ seems, ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ a ▁ true ▁ man ▁ are ▁ vain, ▁ because ▁ i ▁ do ▁ not ▁ ask ▁ strength ▁ of ▁ you .
▁ even ▁ he ▁ to ▁ whom ▁ it ▁ was ▁ said, ▁ 'in ▁ isaac ▁ will ▁ your ▁ seed ▁ be ▁ called;'
▁ make ▁ not ▁ an ▁ hungry ▁ soul ▁ sorrowful; ▁ neither ▁ provoke ▁ a ▁ man ▁ in ▁ his ▁ distress .
▁ these ▁ things ▁ i ▁ have ▁ written ▁ to ▁ you ▁ who ▁ believe ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ you ▁ may ▁ know ▁ that ▁ you ▁ have ▁ eternal ▁ life, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ you ▁ may ▁ continue ▁ to ▁ believe ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ he ▁ gave ▁ them ▁ few ▁ days, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ short ▁ time, ▁ and ▁ power ▁ also ▁ over ▁ the ▁ things ▁ therein .
▁ in ▁ whom ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ building, ▁ fitted ▁ together, ▁ grows ▁ into ▁ a ▁ holy ▁ temple ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lord;
▁ and ▁ we ▁ have ▁ also ▁ been ▁ instructed ▁ in ▁ generosity ▁ and ▁ in ▁ christlikeness .
▁ these ▁ are ▁ the ▁ ways ▁ of ▁ all ▁ that ▁ perform ▁ lawless ▁ deeds; ▁ for ▁ by ▁ ungodliness ▁ they ▁ destroy ▁ their ▁ own ▁ life .
▁ the ▁ old ▁ lion ▁ has ▁ perished ▁ for ▁ want ▁ of ▁ food, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lions' ▁ whelps ▁ have ▁ forsaken ▁ one ▁ another .
▁ continue ▁ steadfastly ▁ in ▁ prayer, ▁ watching ▁ therein ▁ with ▁ thanksgiving;
▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ that ▁ the ▁ city ▁ which ▁ is ▁ nearest ▁ to ▁ the ▁ slain ▁ man ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ of ▁ that ▁ city ▁ shall ▁ take ▁ a ▁ heifer ▁ of ▁ the ▁ herd, ▁ which ▁ has ▁ not ▁ laboured, ▁ and ▁ which ▁ has ▁ not ▁ borne ▁ a ▁ yoke .
▁ hear, ▁ israel, ▁ the ▁ commandments ▁ of ▁ life: ▁ give ▁ ear ▁ to ▁ understand ▁ wisdom .
▁ having ▁ found ▁ disciples, ▁ we ▁ stayed ▁ there ▁ seven ▁ days . ▁ these ▁ said ▁ to ▁ paul ▁ through ▁ the ▁ spirit, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ should ▁ not ▁ go ▁ up ▁ to ▁ jerusalem .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ went, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ the ▁ presents ▁ to ▁ eglom ▁ king ▁ of ▁ moab, ▁ and ▁ eglom ▁ was ▁ a ▁ very ▁ handsome ▁ man .
▁ for ▁ they ▁ hadn't ▁ understood ▁ about ▁ the ▁ loaves, ▁ but ▁ their ▁ hearts ▁ were ▁ hardened .
▁ but ▁ when ▁ the ▁ blade ▁ sprang ▁ up ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ forth ▁ fruit, ▁ then ▁ the ▁ darnel ▁ weeds ▁ appeared ▁ also .
▁ and ▁ when ▁ the ▁ prescriptions ▁ which ▁ had ▁ been ▁ written ▁ upon ▁ them ▁ could ▁ not ▁ be ▁ found ▁ again, ▁ he ▁ went ▁ into ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord,
▁ for ▁ though ▁ i ▁ made ▁ you ▁ sorry ▁ with ▁ my ▁ letter, ▁ i ▁ do ▁ not ▁ regret ▁ it, ▁ though ▁ i ▁ did ▁ regret ▁ it . ▁ for ▁ i ▁ see ▁ that ▁ my ▁ letter ▁ made ▁ you ▁ sorry, ▁ though ▁ just ▁ for ▁ a ▁ while .
▁ how ▁ i ▁ didn't ▁ shrink ▁ from ▁ declaring ▁ to ▁ you ▁ anything ▁ that ▁ was ▁ profitable, ▁ teaching ▁ you ▁ publicly ▁ and ▁ from ▁ house ▁ to ▁ house,
▁ you ▁ will ▁ be ▁ handed ▁ over ▁ even ▁ by ▁ parents, ▁ brothers, ▁ relatives, ▁ and ▁ friends . ▁ they ▁ will ▁ cause ▁ some ▁ of ▁ you ▁ to ▁ be ▁ put ▁ to ▁ death .
▁ every ▁ beast ▁ that ▁ divides ▁ the ▁ hoofs, ▁ and ▁ makes ▁ claws ▁ of ▁ two ▁ divisions, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ chews ▁ the ▁ cud ▁ among ▁ beasts, ▁ these ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ eat .
▁ for ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ they ▁ who ▁ were ▁ not ▁ appointed ▁ to ▁ drink ▁ the ▁ cup ▁ have ▁ drunk ▁ it; ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ by ▁ no ▁ means ▁ be ▁ cleared:
▁ he ▁ sent ▁ signs ▁ and ▁ wonders ▁ into ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ thee, ▁ o ▁ egypt, ▁ on ▁ pharao, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ all ▁ his ▁ servants .
▁ so ▁ the ▁ people ▁ were ▁ dispersed ▁ in ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt, ▁ to ▁ gather ▁ stubble ▁ for ▁ straw .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ say ▁ that ▁ so ▁ long ▁ as ▁ the ▁ heir ▁ is ▁ a ▁ child, ▁ he ▁ is ▁ no ▁ different ▁ from ▁ a ▁ bondservant, ▁ though ▁ he ▁ is ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ all;
▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ come ▁ hither, ▁ and ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god .
▁ all ▁ his ▁ works ▁ are ▁ known ▁ to ▁ god ▁ from ▁ eternity . '
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ in ▁ that ▁ night, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ take ▁ the ▁ young ▁ bullock ▁ which ▁ thy ▁ father ▁ has, ▁ even ▁ the ▁ second ▁ bullock ▁ of ▁ seven ▁ years ▁ old, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ destroy ▁ the ▁ altar ▁ of ▁ baal ▁ which ▁ thy ▁ father ▁ has, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ grove ▁ which ▁ is ▁ by ▁ itthou ▁ shalt ▁ destroy .
▁ all ▁ the ▁ sinners ▁ of ▁ my ▁ people ▁ shall ▁ die ▁ by ▁ the ▁ sword, ▁ who ▁ say, ▁ calamities ▁ shall ▁ certainly ▁ not ▁ draw ▁ near, ▁ nor ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ us .
▁ when ▁ they ▁ had ▁ gone ▁ through ▁ the ▁ region ▁ of ▁ phrygia ▁ and ▁ galatia, ▁ they ▁ were ▁ forbidden ▁ by ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ spirit ▁ to ▁ speak ▁ the ▁ word ▁ in ▁ asia .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ bring ▁ them ▁ on ▁ the ▁ eighth ▁ day, ▁ to ▁ purify ▁ him, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ priest, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ door ▁ of ▁ the ▁ tabernacle ▁ of ▁ witness ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ see ▁ wise ▁ men ▁ dying, ▁ the ▁ fool ▁ and ▁ the ▁ senseless ▁ one ▁ shall ▁ perish ▁ together; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ leave ▁ their ▁ wealth ▁ to ▁ strangers .
▁ now ▁ he ▁ passed ▁ three ▁ days ▁ wherein ▁ he ▁ neither ▁ ate ▁ nor ▁ drank, ▁ neither ▁ did ▁ he ▁ speak ▁ unto ▁ us, ▁ nor ▁ turn ▁ from ▁ one ▁ side ▁ to ▁ the ▁ other, ▁ but ▁ he ▁ lay ▁ stretched ▁ out ▁ like ▁ a ▁ dead ▁ man ▁ in ▁ the ▁ hall ▁ of ▁ the ▁ large ▁ cell .
▁ doesn't ▁ even ▁ nature ▁ itself ▁ teach ▁ you ▁ that ▁ if ▁ a ▁ man ▁ has ▁ long ▁ hair, ▁ it ▁ is ▁ a ▁ dishonor ▁ to ▁ him?
▁ after ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ jesus ▁ came ▁ with ▁ his ▁ disciples ▁ into ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ judea . ▁ he ▁ stayed ▁ there ▁ with ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ baptized .
▁ 'woe ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ scribes ▁ and ▁ pharisees, ▁ hypocrites! ▁ for ▁ you ▁ are ▁ like ▁ whitened ▁ tombs, ▁ which ▁ outwardly ▁ appear ▁ beautiful, ▁ but ▁ inwardly ▁ are ▁ full ▁ of ▁ dead ▁ men's ▁ bones, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ all ▁ uncleanness .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ believes ▁ in ▁ him ▁ is ▁ not ▁ judged . ▁ he ▁ who ▁ doesn't ▁ believe ▁ has ▁ been ▁ judged ▁ already, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ has ▁ not ▁ believed ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ one ▁ and ▁ only ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ be ▁ wise ▁ in ▁ a ▁ blameless ▁ way . ▁ when ▁ wilt ▁ thou ▁ come ▁ to ▁ me? ▁ i ▁ walked ▁ in ▁ the ▁ innocence ▁ of ▁ my ▁ heart, ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ my ▁ house .
▁ and ▁ again, ▁ at ▁ the ▁ time ▁ when ▁ elijah ▁ the ▁ tishbite ▁ was ▁ in ▁ the ▁ desert, ▁ the ▁ ravens ▁ brought ▁ bread ▁ unto ▁ him ▁ every ▁ day ▁ in ▁ the ▁ early ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ again ▁ at ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ evening .
▁ 'behold, ▁ my ▁ servant ▁ whom ▁ i ▁ have ▁ chosen; ▁ my ▁ beloved ▁ in ▁ whom ▁ my ▁ soul ▁ is ▁ well ▁ pleased: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ put ▁ my ▁ spirit ▁ on ▁ him . ▁ he ▁ will ▁ proclaim ▁ justice ▁ to ▁ the ▁ nations .
▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ the ▁ passage ▁ whereby ▁ jonathan ▁ sought ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ over ▁ to ▁ the ▁ encampment ▁ of ▁ the ▁ philistines, ▁ there ▁ was ▁ both ▁ a ▁ sharp ▁ rock ▁ on ▁ this ▁ side, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ sharp ▁ rock ▁ on ▁ the ▁ other ▁ side: ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ one ▁ was ▁ bases, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ other ▁ senna .
▁ so ▁ jacob ▁ ate ▁ and ▁ was ▁ filled, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ beloved ▁ one ▁ kicked; ▁ he ▁ grew ▁ fat, ▁ he ▁ became ▁ thick ▁ and ▁ broad: ▁ then ▁ he ▁ forsook ▁ the ▁ god ▁ that ▁ made ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ god ▁ his ▁ saviour .
▁ thou ▁ seest ▁ the ▁ wound, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ knowest ▁ what ▁ will ▁ heal ▁ it .
▁ use ▁ not ▁ thy ▁ mouth ▁ to ▁ intemperate ▁ swearing, ▁ for ▁ therein ▁ is ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ sin .
▁ so ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ was ▁ very ▁ angry ▁ with ▁ his ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ abhorred ▁ his ▁ inheritance .
▁ these ▁ the ▁ chiefs ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ esau, ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ eliphas, ▁ the ▁ first-born ▁ of ▁ esau; ▁ chief ▁ thaeman, ▁ chief ▁ omar, ▁ chief ▁ sophar, ▁ chief ▁ kenez,
▁ wasn't ▁ abraham ▁ our ▁ father ▁ justified ▁ by ▁ works, ▁ in ▁ that ▁ he ▁ offered ▁ up ▁ isaac ▁ his ▁ son ▁ on ▁ the ▁ altar?
▁ and ▁ place ▁ a ▁ pure ▁ mitre ▁ upon ▁ his ▁ head . ▁ so ▁ they ▁ placed ▁ a ▁ pure ▁ mitre ▁ upon ▁ his ▁ head, ▁ and ▁ clothed ▁ him ▁ with ▁ garments: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ angel ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ stood ▁ by .
▁ rise ▁ up, ▁ ye ▁ rich ▁ women, ▁ and ▁ hear ▁ my ▁ voice; ▁ ye ▁ confident ▁ daughters, ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ my ▁ words .
▁ i ▁ myself ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ put ▁ to ▁ shame ▁ because ▁ of ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ disgraced ▁ before ▁ the ▁ emperor ▁ and ▁ his ▁ servants, ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ setting ▁ at ▁ naught ▁ the ▁ law ▁ of ▁ the ▁ emperors, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ shewing ▁ thyself ▁ to ▁ be ▁ an ▁ ill-educated ▁ young ▁ man ▁ among ▁ thy ▁ companions . ▁ and ▁ they ▁ will ▁ take ▁ away ▁ from ▁ thee ▁ thy ▁ rations, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ emperor ▁ will ▁ be ▁ angered ▁ because ▁ of ▁ thee .
▁ the ▁ sick ▁ man ▁ answered ▁ him, ▁ 'sir, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ no ▁ one ▁ to ▁ put ▁ me ▁ into ▁ the ▁ pool ▁ when ▁ the ▁ water ▁ is ▁ stirred ▁ up, ▁ but ▁ while ▁ i'm ▁ coming, ▁ another ▁ steps ▁ down ▁ before ▁ me . '
▁ a ▁ man ▁ shall ▁ say, ▁ sion ▁ is ▁ my ▁ mother; ▁ and ▁ such ▁ a ▁ man ▁ was ▁ born ▁ in ▁ her; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ highest ▁ himself ▁ has ▁ founded ▁ her .
▁ there ▁ i ▁ will ▁ give ▁ thee ▁ my ▁ breasts: ▁ my ▁ soul ▁ knew ▁ it ▁ not: ▁ it ▁ made ▁ me ▁ as ▁ the ▁ chariots ▁ of ▁ aminadab .
▁ then ▁ he ▁ has ▁ said, ▁ 'behold, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ come ▁ to ▁ do ▁ your ▁ will . ' ▁ he ▁ takes ▁ away ▁ the ▁ first, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ may ▁ establish ▁ the ▁ second,
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ be ▁ angry ▁ with ▁ you, ▁ and ▁ restrain ▁ the ▁ heaven; ▁ and ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ rain, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ yield ▁ its ▁ fruit, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ perish ▁ quickly ▁ from ▁ off ▁ the ▁ good ▁ land, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ given ▁ you .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ heli ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ were ▁ evil ▁ sons, ▁ not ▁ knowing ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ then ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ shall ▁ magnify ▁ thy ▁ plagues, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ plagues ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ seed, ▁ great ▁ and ▁ wonderful ▁ plagues, ▁ and ▁ evil ▁ and ▁ abiding ▁ diseases .
▁ observe ▁ the ▁ commandment ▁ of ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ because ▁ of ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ oath ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ bring ▁ forth ▁ the ▁ sickles, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ vintage ▁ is ▁ come: ▁ go ▁ in, ▁ tread ▁ the ▁ grapes, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ press ▁ is ▁ full: ▁ cause ▁ the ▁ vats ▁ to ▁ overflow; ▁ for ▁ their ▁ wickedness ▁ is ▁ multiplied .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ congregation ▁ sent ▁ thither ▁ twelve ▁ thousand ▁ men ▁ of ▁ the ▁ strongest, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ charged ▁ them, ▁ saying, ▁ go ▁ ye ▁ and ▁ smite ▁ the ▁ inhabitants ▁ of ▁ jabis ▁ galaad ▁ with ▁ the ▁ edge ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sword .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ when ▁ judin ▁ had ▁ read ▁ three ▁ or ▁ four ▁ leaves, ▁ he ▁ cut ▁ them ▁ off ▁ with ▁ a ▁ penknife, ▁ and ▁ cast ▁ them ▁ into ▁ the ▁ fire ▁ that ▁ was ▁ on ▁ the ▁ hearth, ▁ until ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ roll ▁ was ▁ consumed ▁ in ▁ the ▁ fire ▁ that ▁ was ▁ on ▁ the ▁ hearth .
▁ our ▁ help ▁ is ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ who ▁ made ▁ heaven ▁ and ▁ earth .
▁ no ▁ one ▁ has ▁ seen ▁ god ▁ at ▁ any ▁ time . ▁ if ▁ we ▁ love ▁ one ▁ another, ▁ god ▁ remains ▁ in ▁ us, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ love ▁ has ▁ been ▁ perfected ▁ in ▁ us .
▁ for ▁ as ▁ you ▁ in ▁ time ▁ past ▁ were ▁ disobedient ▁ to ▁ god, ▁ but ▁ now ▁ have ▁ obtained ▁ mercy ▁ by ▁ their ▁ disobedience,
▁ they ▁ surrounded ▁ me ▁ with ▁ spears, ▁ aiming ▁ at ▁ my ▁ reins: ▁ without ▁ sparing ▁ me ▁ they ▁ poured ▁ out ▁ my ▁ gall ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ ground .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ cried ▁ to ▁ thee, ▁ o ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning ▁ shall ▁ my ▁ prayer ▁ prevent ▁ thee .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ full ▁ of ▁ trodden ▁ grape, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ there ▁ is ▁ not ▁ a ▁ man ▁ with ▁ me; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ trampled ▁ them ▁ in ▁ my ▁ fury, ▁ and ▁ dashed ▁ them ▁ to ▁ pieces ▁ as ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ down ▁ their ▁ blood ▁ to ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ lifted ▁ up ▁ my ▁ hands ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ commandments ▁ which ▁ i ▁ loved; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ meditated ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ ordinances .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ gesion ▁ gaber, ▁ and ▁ encamped ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ of ▁ sin; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ of ▁ sin, ▁ and ▁ encamped ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ of ▁ pharan; ▁ this ▁ is ▁ cades .
▁ say ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ knowest ▁ the ▁ time ▁ of ▁ the ▁ bringing ▁ forth ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wild ▁ goats ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rock, ▁ and ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ marked ▁ the ▁ calving ▁ of ▁ the ▁ hinds:
▁ let ▁ the ▁ mountains ▁ and ▁ the ▁ hills ▁ raise ▁ peace ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ people:
▁ who ▁ knows ▁ the ▁ power ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ wrath?
▁ o ▁ house ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ bless ▁ ye ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ o ▁ house ▁ of ▁ aaron, ▁ bless ▁ ye ▁ the ▁ lord:
▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ throw ▁ stones, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ gather ▁ stones ▁ together; ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ embrace, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ time ▁ to ▁ abstain ▁ from ▁ embracing;
▁ i ▁ will ▁ liken ▁ thee ▁ unto ▁ noah, ▁ of ▁ whose ▁ holy ▁ sacrifice ▁ god ▁ smelled ▁ (the ▁ sweet ▁ savour) . ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ taste ▁ that ▁ the ▁ working ▁ was ▁ good, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ lamp ▁ was ▁ not ▁ extinguished ▁ during ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ night .
▁ how ▁ he ▁ had ▁ wrought ▁ his ▁ signs ▁ in ▁ egypt, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ wonders ▁ in ▁ the ▁ field ▁ of ▁ tanes:
▁ in ▁ that ▁ day ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ sing ▁ this ▁ song ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ judea; ▁ behold ▁ a ▁ strong ▁ city; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ make ▁ salvation ▁ its ▁ wall ▁ and ▁ bulwark .
▁ now ▁ there ▁ were ▁ six ▁ water ▁ pots ▁ of ▁ stone ▁ set ▁ there ▁ after ▁ the ▁ jews' ▁ manner ▁ of ▁ purifying, ▁ containing ▁ two ▁ or ▁ three ▁ metretes ▁ apiece .
▁ why ▁ do ▁ you ▁ see ▁ the ▁ speck ▁ of ▁ chaff ▁ that ▁ is ▁ in ▁ your ▁ brother's ▁ eye, ▁ but ▁ don't ▁ consider ▁ the ▁ beam ▁ that ▁ is ▁ in ▁ your ▁ own ▁ eye?
▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ when ▁ god ▁ will ▁ judge ▁ the ▁ secrets ▁ of ▁ men, ▁ according ▁ to ▁ my ▁ good ▁ news, ▁ by ▁ jesus ▁ christ .
▁ he ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ 'it ▁ was ▁ a ▁ kind ▁ of ▁ apple . '
▁ and ▁ the ▁ king ▁ said ▁ to ▁ orna, ▁ nay, ▁ but ▁ i ▁ will ▁ surely ▁ buy ▁ it ▁ of ▁ thee ▁ at ▁ a ▁ fair ▁ price, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ offer ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ my ▁ god ▁ a ▁ whole-burnt-offering ▁ for ▁ nothing . ▁ so ▁ david ▁ purchased ▁ the ▁ threshing-floor ▁ and ▁ the ▁ oxen ▁ for ▁ fifty ▁ shekels ▁ of ▁ silver .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ woman ▁ of ▁ thecoe ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ on ▁ me, ▁ my ▁ lord, ▁ o ▁ king, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ my ▁ father's ▁ house ▁ be ▁ the ▁ iniquity, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ king ▁ and ▁ his ▁ throne ▁ be ▁ guiltless .
▁ and ▁ david ▁ gathered ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ went ▁ to ▁ rabbath, ▁ and ▁ fought ▁ against ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ took ▁ it .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ too ▁ i ▁ was ▁ glad ▁ at ▁ the ▁ fall ▁ of ▁ mine ▁ enemies, ▁ and ▁ mine ▁ heart ▁ said, ▁ aha!
▁ surely ▁ i ▁ will ▁ keep ▁ close ▁ nothing ▁ from ▁ you . ▁ for ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ it ▁ was ▁ good ▁ to ▁ keep ▁ close ▁ the ▁ secret ▁ of ▁ a ▁ king, ▁ but ▁ that ▁ it ▁ was ▁ honourable ▁ to ▁ reveal ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ not ▁ drive ▁ them ▁ out ▁ from ▁ before ▁ you, ▁ but ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ for ▁ a ▁ distress ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ gods ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ to ▁ you ▁ for ▁ an ▁ offence .
▁ he ▁ crieth ▁ out ▁ unto ▁ us ▁ ourselves ▁ saying, ▁ 'my ▁ son, ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ sinned; ▁ do ▁ not ▁ (sin) ▁ again'
▁ and ▁ to ▁ raise ▁ up ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ my ▁ skin ▁ that ▁ endures ▁ these ▁ sufferings: ▁ for ▁ these ▁ things ▁ have ▁ been ▁ accomplished ▁ to ▁ me ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord;
▁ and ▁ having ▁ a ▁ great ▁ priest ▁ over ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ god,
▁ if ▁ balac ▁ should ▁ give ▁ me ▁ his ▁ house ▁ full ▁ of ▁ silver ▁ and ▁ gold, ▁ i ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ able ▁ to ▁ transgress ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ to ▁ make ▁ it ▁ good ▁ or ▁ bad ▁ by ▁ myself; ▁ whatsoever ▁ things ▁ god ▁ shall ▁ say, ▁ them ▁ will ▁ i ▁ speak .
▁ you ▁ also, ▁ as ▁ living ▁ stones, ▁ are ▁ built ▁ up ▁ as ▁ a ▁ spiritual ▁ house, ▁ to ▁ be ▁ a ▁ holy ▁ priesthood, ▁ to ▁ offer ▁ up ▁ spiritual ▁ sacrifices, ▁ acceptable ▁ to ▁ god ▁ through ▁ jesus ▁ christ .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ came ▁ upon ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ judged ▁ israel; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ went ▁ out ▁ to ▁ war ▁ against ▁ chusarsathaim: ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ delivered ▁ into ▁ his ▁ hand ▁ chusarsathaim ▁ king ▁ of ▁ syria ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rivers, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ hand ▁ prevailed ▁ against ▁ chusarsathaim .
▁ they ▁ shall ▁ speak ▁ of ▁ the ▁ glory ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ kingdom, ▁ and ▁ talk ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ dominion;
▁ remember ▁ your ▁ leaders, ▁ men ▁ who ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ you ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ considering ▁ the ▁ results ▁ of ▁ their ▁ conduct, ▁ imitate ▁ their ▁ faith .
▁ and ▁ david ▁ again ▁ gathered ▁ all ▁ the ▁ young ▁ men ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ about ▁ seventy ▁ thousand .
▁ he ▁ denied ▁ jesus, ▁ saying, ▁ 'woman, ▁ i ▁ don't ▁ know ▁ him . '
▁ if ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ not ▁ able ▁ to ▁ attain ▁ unto ▁ perfection, ▁ and ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ not ▁ able ▁ to ▁ become ▁ like ▁ a ▁ sun, ▁ then ▁ make ▁ thyself ▁ to ▁ be ▁ like ▁ unto ▁ a ▁ star .
▁ many ▁ daughters ▁ have ▁ obtained ▁ wealth, ▁ many ▁ have ▁ wrought ▁ valiantly; ▁ but ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ exceeded, ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ surpassed ▁ all .
▁ troubles ▁ come ▁ on ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ secret ▁ chambers, ▁ and ▁ cold ▁ from ▁ the ▁ mountain-tops .
▁ turn ▁ us, ▁ o ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ of ▁ hosts, ▁ and ▁ cause ▁ thy ▁ face ▁ to ▁ shine; ▁ and ▁ we ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ saved . ▁ pause .
▁ the ▁ end ▁ of ▁ a ▁ matter ▁ is ▁ better ▁ than ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ thereof: ▁ the ▁ patient ▁ is ▁ better ▁ than ▁ the ▁ high-minded .
▁ how ▁ should ▁ we ▁ sing ▁ the ▁ lord's ▁ song ▁ in ▁ a ▁ strange ▁ land?
▁ our ▁ inheritance ▁ has ▁ been ▁ turned ▁ away ▁ to ▁ aliens, ▁ our ▁ houses ▁ to ▁ strangers:
▁ each ▁ of ▁ whom ▁ was ▁ associated ▁ with ▁ the ▁ throne ▁ of ▁ priesthood ▁ like ▁ unto ▁ thyself .
▁ he ▁ neither ▁ ate ▁ food ▁ with ▁ his ▁ father ▁ nor ▁ did ▁ he ▁ enter ▁ into ▁ converse ▁ with ▁ him ▁ in ▁ the ▁ presence ▁ of ▁ any ▁ one ▁ who ▁ was ▁ greater ▁ than ▁ himself .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ rich, ▁ in ▁ that ▁ he ▁ is ▁ made ▁ humble, ▁ because ▁ like ▁ the ▁ flower ▁ in ▁ the ▁ grass, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ pass ▁ away .
▁ to ▁ whom ▁ dost ▁ thou ▁ attach ▁ thyself, ▁ or ▁ whom ▁ art ▁ thou ▁ going ▁ to ▁ assist? ▁ is ▁ it ▁ not ▁ he ▁ that ▁ has ▁ much ▁ strength, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ who ▁ has ▁ a ▁ strong ▁ arm?
▁ and ▁ all ▁ israel ▁ shall ▁ hear, ▁ and ▁ fear, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ again ▁ do ▁ according ▁ to ▁ this ▁ evil ▁ thing ▁ among ▁ you .
▁ take ▁ heed ▁ to ▁ thyself ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ do ▁ not ▁ desert ▁ the ▁ levite ▁ all ▁ the ▁ time ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ livest ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ will ▁ he ▁ cut ▁ off ▁ his ▁ mercy ▁ for ▁ ever, ▁ even ▁ for ▁ ever ▁ and ▁ ever?
▁ and ▁ abessa ▁ the ▁ brother ▁ of ▁ joab ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ saruia, ▁ he ▁ was ▁ chief ▁ among ▁ the ▁ three, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ lifted ▁ up ▁ his ▁ spear ▁ against ▁ three ▁ hundred ▁ whom ▁ he ▁ slew; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ had ▁ a ▁ name ▁ among ▁ three .
▁ since ▁ peter, ▁ when ▁ he ▁ saw ▁ only ▁ the ▁ very ▁ smallest ▁ portion ▁ of ▁ the ▁ light ▁ of ▁ the ▁ glory
▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ jesus, ▁ 'lord, ▁ remember ▁ me ▁ when ▁ you ▁ come ▁ into ▁ your ▁ kingdom . '
▁ therefore ▁ my ▁ people ▁ have ▁ been ▁ taken ▁ captive, ▁ because ▁ they ▁ know ▁ not ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ and ▁ there ▁ has ▁ been ▁ a ▁ multitude ▁ of ▁ dead ▁ bodies, ▁ because ▁ of ▁ hunger ▁ and ▁ of ▁ thirst ▁ for ▁ water .
▁ do ▁ this, ▁ knowing ▁ the ▁ time, ▁ that ▁ it ▁ is ▁ already ▁ time ▁ for ▁ you ▁ to ▁ awaken ▁ out ▁ of ▁ sleep, ▁ for ▁ salvation ▁ is ▁ now ▁ nearer ▁ to ▁ us ▁ than ▁ when ▁ we ▁ first ▁ believed .
▁ the ▁ sky ▁ was ▁ removed ▁ like ▁ a ▁ scroll ▁ when ▁ it ▁ is ▁ rolled ▁ up . ▁ every ▁ mountain ▁ and ▁ island ▁ were ▁ moved ▁ out ▁ of ▁ their ▁ places .
▁ blessed ▁ be ▁ god, ▁ who ▁ has ▁ not ▁ turned ▁ away ▁ my ▁ prayer, ▁ nor ▁ his ▁ mercy ▁ from ▁ me .
▁ my ▁ son, ▁ defraud ▁ not ▁ the ▁ poor ▁ of ▁ his ▁ living, ▁ and ▁ make ▁ not ▁ the ▁ needy ▁ eyes ▁ to ▁ wait ▁ long .
▁ evil ▁ men ▁ will ▁ not ▁ understand ▁ judgment: ▁ but ▁ they ▁ that ▁ seek ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ will ▁ understand ▁ everything .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ had ▁ said ▁ this, ▁ an ▁ argument ▁ arose ▁ between ▁ the ▁ pharisees ▁ and ▁ sadducees, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ assembly ▁ was ▁ divided .
▁ now ▁ it ▁ happened, ▁ while ▁ he ▁ executed ▁ the ▁ priest's ▁ office ▁ before ▁ god ▁ in ▁ the ▁ order ▁ of ▁ his ▁ division,
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ took ▁ of ▁ his ▁ blood, ▁ and ▁ put ▁ it ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ tip ▁ of ▁ aaron's ▁ right ▁ ear, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ the ▁ thumb ▁ of ▁ his ▁ right ▁ hand, ▁ and ▁ on ▁ the ▁ great ▁ toe ▁ of ▁ his ▁ right ▁ foot .
▁ joseph ▁ went ▁ in ▁ to ▁ them ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ saw ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ had ▁ been ▁ troubled .
▁ the ▁ small ▁ and ▁ great ▁ are ▁ there, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ servant ▁ that ▁ feared ▁ his ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ woe ▁ is ▁ me, ▁ for ▁ i ▁ am ▁ pricked ▁ to ▁ the ▁ heart; ▁ for ▁ being ▁ a ▁ man, ▁ and ▁ having ▁ unclean ▁ lips, ▁ i ▁ dwell ▁ in ▁ the ▁ midst ▁ of ▁ a ▁ people ▁ having ▁ unclean ▁ lips; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ seen ▁ with ▁ mine ▁ eyes ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ hosts .
▁ but ▁ a ▁ certain ▁ fearful ▁ expectation ▁ of ▁ judgment, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ fierceness ▁ of ▁ fire ▁ which ▁ will ▁ devour ▁ the ▁ adversaries .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ god ▁ shall ▁ rest ▁ upon ▁ him, ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ wisdom ▁ and ▁ understanding, ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ counsel ▁ and ▁ strength, ▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ knowledge ▁ and ▁ godliness ▁ shall ▁ fill ▁ him;
▁ for ▁ our ▁ iniquity ▁ is ▁ great ▁ before ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ our ▁ sins ▁ have ▁ risen ▁ up ▁ against ▁ us: ▁ for ▁ our ▁ iniquities ▁ are ▁ in ▁ us, ▁ and ▁ we ▁ know ▁ our ▁ unrighteous ▁ deeds .
▁ and ▁ this ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ your ▁ northern ▁ border; ▁ from ▁ the ▁ great ▁ sea ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ measure ▁ to ▁ yourselves, ▁ by ▁ the ▁ side ▁ of ▁ the ▁ mountain .
▁ for ▁ with ▁ the ▁ fire ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ all ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ judged, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ flesh ▁ with ▁ his ▁ sword: ▁ many ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ slain ▁ by ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ the ▁ pharisee ▁ stood ▁ and ▁ prayed ▁ to ▁ himself ▁ like ▁ this: ▁ 'god, ▁ i ▁ thank ▁ you, ▁ that ▁ i ▁ am ▁ not ▁ like ▁ the ▁ rest ▁ of ▁ men, ▁ extortioners, ▁ unrighteous, ▁ adulterers, ▁ or ▁ even ▁ like ▁ this ▁ tax ▁ collector .
▁ and ▁ as ▁ (the ▁ crew) ▁ are ▁ tying ▁ the ▁ boat ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ bank, ▁ the ▁ duke ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ forth .
▁ and ▁ this ▁ book ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ given ▁ into ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ a ▁ man ▁ that ▁ is ▁ unlearned, ▁ and ▁ one ▁ shall ▁ say ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ read ▁ this; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ say, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ not ▁ learned .
▁ then ▁ let ▁ those ▁ who ▁ are ▁ in ▁ judea ▁ flee ▁ to ▁ the ▁ mountains .
▁ for ▁ it ▁ is ▁ for ▁ thine ▁ own ▁ sake ▁ that ▁ i ▁ have ▁ appeared ▁ unto ▁ thee ▁ 'in ▁ the ▁ form ▁ of ▁ this ▁ animal .
▁ even ▁ thy ▁ power ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ righteousness, ▁ o ▁ god, ▁ up ▁ to ▁ the ▁ highest ▁ heavens, ▁ even ▁ the ▁ mighty ▁ works ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ has ▁ done: ▁ o ▁ god, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ like ▁ to ▁ thee?
▁ but ▁ he ▁ was ▁ rebuked ▁ for ▁ his ▁ own ▁ disobedience . ▁ a ▁ mute ▁ donkey ▁ spoke ▁ with ▁ a ▁ man's ▁ voice ▁ and ▁ stopped ▁ the ▁ madness ▁ of ▁ the ▁ prophet .
▁ a ▁ senseless ▁ man ▁ feels ▁ no ▁ need ▁ of ▁ wisdom, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ is ▁ rather ▁ led ▁ by ▁ folly .
▁ do ▁ thou ▁ then, ▁ o ▁ john, ▁ buy ▁ a ▁ covering ▁ for ▁ my ▁ body, ▁ and ▁ do ▁ not ▁ put ▁ on ▁ me ▁ anything ▁ except ▁ the ▁ shroud ▁ wherein ▁ i ▁ am ▁ wrapped, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ monk's ▁ dress, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ skull-cap, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ girdle, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ tunic—only ▁ these—and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ prepare ▁ me ▁ for ▁ burial ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ bury ▁ me .
▁ princes ▁ are ▁ prone ▁ to ▁ anger: ▁ let ▁ them ▁ then ▁ not ▁ drink ▁ wine:
▁ the ▁ great ▁ dragon ▁ was ▁ thrown ▁ down, ▁ the ▁ old ▁ serpent, ▁ he ▁ who ▁ is ▁ called ▁ the ▁ devil ▁ and ▁ satan, ▁ the ▁ deceiver ▁ of ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ world . ▁ he ▁ was ▁ thrown ▁ down ▁ to ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ angels ▁ were ▁ thrown ▁ down ▁ with ▁ him .
▁ the ▁ spirit ▁ of ▁ the ▁ fear ▁ of ▁ god . ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ judge ▁ according ▁ to ▁ appearance, ▁ nor ▁ reprove ▁ according ▁ to ▁ report:
▁ the ▁ thoughts ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wise ▁ are ▁ ways ▁ of ▁ life, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ may ▁ turn ▁ aside ▁ and ▁ escape ▁ from ▁ hell .
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ have ▁ power ▁ to ▁ sacrifice ▁ the ▁ passover ▁ in ▁ any ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cities, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ gives ▁ thee .
▁ thine ▁ is ▁ the ▁ mighty ▁ arm: ▁ let ▁ thy ▁ hand ▁ be ▁ strengthened, ▁ let ▁ thy ▁ right ▁ hand ▁ be ▁ exalted .
▁ see, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ given ▁ you ▁ this ▁ day ▁ as ▁ the ▁ sabbath, ▁ therefore ▁ he ▁ has ▁ given ▁ you ▁ on ▁ the ▁ sixth ▁ day ▁ the ▁ bread ▁ of ▁ two ▁ days: ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ sit ▁ each ▁ of ▁ you ▁ in ▁ your ▁ houses; ▁ let ▁ no ▁ one ▁ go ▁ forth ▁ from ▁ his ▁ place ▁ on ▁ the ▁ seventh ▁ day .
▁ one ▁ of ▁ his ▁ heads ▁ looked ▁ like ▁ it ▁ had ▁ been ▁ wounded ▁ fatally . ▁ his ▁ fatal ▁ wound ▁ was ▁ healed, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ earth ▁ marveled ▁ at ▁ the ▁ beast .
▁ jesus ▁ said, ▁ 'i ▁ came ▁ into ▁ this ▁ world ▁ for ▁ judgment, ▁ that ▁ those ▁ who ▁ don't ▁ see ▁ may ▁ see; ▁ and ▁ that ▁ those ▁ who ▁ see ▁ may ▁ become ▁ blind . '
▁ 'i ▁ will ▁ remember ▁ their ▁ sins ▁ and ▁ their ▁ iniquities ▁ no ▁ more . '
▁ save ▁ caleb ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ jephonne, ▁ who ▁ was ▁ set ▁ apart, ▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ naue, ▁ for ▁ they ▁ closely ▁ followed ▁ after ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ woe ▁ be ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ my ▁ son, ▁ my ▁ sweet ▁ one, ▁ thou ▁ face ▁ full ▁ of ▁ joy!
▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ in ▁ that ▁ day ▁ that ▁ god ▁ shall ▁ fence ▁ men ▁ off ▁ from ▁ the ▁ channel ▁ of ▁ the ▁ river ▁ as ▁ far ▁ as ▁ rhinocorura; ▁ but ▁ do ▁ ye ▁ gather ▁ one ▁ by ▁ one ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ i ▁ said ▁ to ▁ laughter, ▁ madness: ▁ and ▁ to ▁ mirth, ▁ why ▁ doest ▁ thou ▁ this:
▁ o ▁ ye ▁ simple, ▁ understand ▁ subtlety, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ that ▁ are ▁ untaught, ▁ imbibe ▁ knowledge .
▁ why ▁ am ▁ i ▁ so ▁ favored, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ mother ▁ of ▁ my ▁ lord ▁ should ▁ come ▁ to ▁ me?
▁ from ▁ now ▁ on, ▁ there ▁ is ▁ stored ▁ up ▁ for ▁ me ▁ the ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ righteousness, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ the ▁ righteous ▁ judge, ▁ will ▁ give ▁ to ▁ me ▁ on ▁ that ▁ day; ▁ and ▁ not ▁ to ▁ me ▁ only, ▁ but ▁ also ▁ to ▁ all ▁ those ▁ who ▁ have ▁ loved ▁ his ▁ appearing .
▁ where ▁ it ▁ was ▁ deposited ▁ in ▁ the ▁ church ▁ for ▁ the ▁ benefit ▁ of ▁ those ▁ who ▁ should ▁ hear ▁ it ▁ [read] .
▁ and ▁ ana ▁ victor ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ the ▁ duke,
▁ trust ▁ not ▁ in ▁ friends, ▁ and ▁ confide ▁ not ▁ in ▁ guides: ▁ beware ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ wife, ▁ so ▁ as ▁ not ▁ to ▁ commit ▁ anything ▁ to ▁ her .
▁ then ▁ the ▁ men ▁ feared ▁ exceedingly, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ what ▁ is ▁ this ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ done? ▁ for ▁ the ▁ men ▁ knew ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ fleeing ▁ from ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ had ▁ told ▁ them .
▁ behold ▁ that ▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ laboured ▁ for ▁ myself ▁ only, ▁ but ▁ for ▁ all ▁ them ▁ that ▁ seek ▁ wisdom .
▁ maintaining ▁ also ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ city, ▁ and ▁ staying ▁ themselves ▁ on ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel: ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ hosts ▁ is ▁ his ▁ name . ▁ the ▁ former ▁ things ▁ i ▁ have ▁ already ▁ declared;
▁ i ▁ saw ▁ [there] ▁ all ▁ the ▁ ranks ▁ of ▁ the ▁ angels .
▁ as ▁ the ▁ climbing ▁ up ▁ a ▁ sandy ▁ way ▁ is ▁ to ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ the ▁ aged, ▁ so ▁ is ▁ a ▁ wife ▁ full ▁ of ▁ words ▁ to ▁ a ▁ quiet ▁ man .
▁ and ▁ these ▁ were ▁ the ▁ words ▁ which ▁ he ▁ addressed ▁ to ▁ them . ▁ i, ▁ [your] ▁ brother, ▁ was ▁ thinking ▁ one ▁ day, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ determined ▁ to ▁ go ▁ into ▁ the ▁ inner ▁ desert, ▁ so ▁ that ▁ i ▁ might ▁ see ▁ if ▁ there ▁ were ▁ any ▁ brethren ▁ who ▁ were ▁ monks ▁ living ▁ in ▁ the ▁ most ▁ remote ▁ parts ▁ of ▁ it .
▁ give ▁ ear ▁ to ▁ my ▁ prayer, ▁ o ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ attend ▁ to ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ my ▁ supplication .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lamp ▁ of ▁ god ▁ was ▁ burning ▁ before ▁ it ▁ was ▁ trimmed, ▁ and ▁ samuel ▁ slept ▁ in ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ where ▁ was ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ verily, ▁ o ▁ my ▁ mother ▁ i ▁ am ▁ become ▁ an ▁ orphan, ▁ fatherless ▁ and ▁ motherless .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ bring ▁ to ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ the ▁ torrent ▁ of ▁ kison ▁ sisara ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ host ▁ of ▁ jabin, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ chariots, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ multitude, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ deliver ▁ them ▁ into ▁ thine ▁ hands .
▁ the ▁ vision ▁ of ▁ obdias . ▁ thus ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ to ▁ idumea; ▁ i ▁ have ▁ heard ▁ a ▁ report ▁ from ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ has ▁ sent ▁ forth ▁ a ▁ message ▁ to ▁ the ▁ nations .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ woman ▁ had ▁ a ▁ fat ▁ heifer ▁ in ▁ the ▁ house; ▁ and ▁ she ▁ hasted ▁ and ▁ slew ▁ it; ▁ and ▁ she ▁ took ▁ meal ▁ and ▁ kneaded ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ baked ▁ unleavened ▁ cakes .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ set ▁ thy ▁ borders ▁ from ▁ the ▁ red ▁ sea, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ sea ▁ of ▁ the ▁ phylistines, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ to ▁ the ▁ great ▁ river ▁ euphrates; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ give ▁ into ▁ your ▁ hand ▁ those ▁ that ▁ dwell ▁ in ▁ the ▁ land, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ cast ▁ them ▁ out ▁ from ▁ thee .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ grieved ▁ exceedingly ▁ for ▁ plaketas,
▁ receiving ▁ the ▁ wages ▁ of ▁ unrighteousness; ▁ people ▁ who ▁ count ▁ it ▁ pleasure ▁ to ▁ revel ▁ in ▁ the ▁ daytime, ▁ spots ▁ and ▁ blemishes, ▁ reveling ▁ in ▁ their ▁ deceit ▁ while ▁ they ▁ feast ▁ with ▁ you;
▁ and ▁ let ▁ no ▁ one ▁ go ▁ up ▁ with ▁ thee, ▁ nor ▁ be ▁ seen ▁ in ▁ all ▁ the ▁ mountain; ▁ and ▁ let ▁ not ▁ the ▁ sheep ▁ and ▁ oxen ▁ feed ▁ near ▁ that ▁ mountain .
▁ now ▁ all ▁ the ▁ athenians ▁ and ▁ the ▁ strangers ▁ living ▁ there ▁ spent ▁ their ▁ time ▁ in ▁ nothing ▁ else, ▁ but ▁ either ▁ to ▁ tell ▁ or ▁ to ▁ hear ▁ some ▁ new ▁ thing .
▁ most ▁ certainly, ▁ i ▁ tell ▁ you, ▁ whoever ▁ doesn't ▁ receive ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ god ▁ like ▁ a ▁ little ▁ child, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ in ▁ no ▁ way ▁ enter ▁ into ▁ it . '
▁ so ▁ moses ▁ brought ▁ up ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ from ▁ the ▁ red ▁ sea, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ them ▁ into ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ of ▁ sur; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ went ▁ three ▁ days ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wilderness, ▁ and ▁ found ▁ no ▁ water ▁ to ▁ drink .
▁ i ▁ heard ▁ the ▁ angel ▁ of ▁ the ▁ waters ▁ saying, ▁ 'you ▁ are ▁ righteous, ▁ who ▁ are ▁ and ▁ who ▁ were, ▁ you ▁ holy ▁ one, ▁ because ▁ you ▁ have ▁ judged ▁ these ▁ things .
▁ and ▁ berzelli ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ how ▁ many ▁ are ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ the ▁ years ▁ of ▁ my ▁ life, ▁ that ▁ i ▁ should ▁ go ▁ up ▁ with ▁ the ▁ king ▁ to ▁ jerusalem?
▁ and ▁ i ▁ asked ▁ the ▁ second ▁ time, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ what ▁ are ▁ the ▁ two ▁ branches ▁ of ▁ the ▁ olive-trees ▁ that ▁ are ▁ by ▁ the ▁ side ▁ of ▁ the ▁ two ▁ golden ▁ pipes ▁ that ▁ pour ▁ into ▁ and ▁ communicate ▁ with ▁ the ▁ golden ▁ oil ▁ funnels?
▁ you ▁ see ▁ then ▁ that ▁ by ▁ works, ▁ a ▁ man ▁ is ▁ justified, ▁ and ▁ not ▁ only ▁ by ▁ faith .
▁ so ▁ god ▁ requited ▁ the ▁ wickedness ▁ of ▁ abimelech, ▁ which ▁ he ▁ wrought ▁ against ▁ his ▁ father, ▁ in ▁ slaying ▁ his ▁ seventy ▁ brethren .
▁ for ▁ who ▁ is ▁ he ▁ that ▁ has ▁ fellowship ▁ with ▁ all ▁ the ▁ living? ▁ there ▁ is ▁ hope ▁ of ▁ him: ▁ for ▁ a ▁ living ▁ dog ▁ is ▁ better ▁ than ▁ a ▁ dead ▁ lion .
▁ they ▁ ate, ▁ and ▁ were ▁ all ▁ filled . ▁ they ▁ gathered ▁ up ▁ twelve ▁ baskets ▁ of ▁ broken ▁ pieces ▁ that ▁ were ▁ left ▁ over .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ distributed ▁ to ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ even ▁ to ▁ all ▁ the ▁ host ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ from ▁ dan ▁ to ▁ bersabee, ▁ both ▁ men ▁ and ▁ women, ▁ to ▁ every ▁ one ▁ a ▁ cake ▁ of ▁ bread, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ joint ▁ of ▁ meat, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ cake ▁ from ▁ the ▁ frying-pan: ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people ▁ departed ▁ every ▁ one ▁ to ▁ his ▁ home .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ go ▁ forth, ▁ and ▁ stand ▁ near ▁ my ▁ father ▁ in ▁ the ▁ field ▁ where ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ be, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ speak ▁ concerning ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ my ▁ father; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ see ▁ what ▁ his ▁ answer ▁ may ▁ be, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ tell ▁ thee .
▁ she ▁ has ▁ killed ▁ her ▁ beasts; ▁ she ▁ has ▁ mingled ▁ her ▁ wine ▁ in ▁ a ▁ bowl, ▁ and ▁ prepared ▁ her ▁ table .
▁ who ▁ 'will ▁ pay ▁ back ▁ to ▁ everyone ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ works:'
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ took ▁ the ▁ blood ▁ and ▁ sprinkled ▁ it ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ behold ▁ the ▁ blood ▁ of ▁ the ▁ covenant, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ made ▁ with ▁ you ▁ concerning ▁ all ▁ these ▁ words .
▁ kindle ▁ not ▁ the ▁ coals ▁ of ▁ a ▁ sinner, ▁ lest ▁ thou ▁ be ▁ burnt ▁ with ▁ the ▁ flame ▁ of ▁ his ▁ fire .
▁ when ▁ peter ▁ knocked ▁ at ▁ the ▁ door ▁ of ▁ the ▁ gate, ▁ a ▁ maid ▁ named ▁ rhoda ▁ came ▁ to ▁ answer .
▁ but ▁ if ▁ the ▁ spot ▁ be ▁ clear ▁ and ▁ white ▁ in ▁ the ▁ skin ▁ of ▁ his ▁ flesh, ▁ yet ▁ the ▁ appearance ▁ of ▁ it ▁ be ▁ not ▁ deep ▁ below ▁ the ▁ skin, ▁ and ▁ its ▁ hair ▁ have ▁ not ▁ changed ▁ itself ▁ for ▁ white ▁ hair, ▁ but ▁ it ▁ is ▁ dark, ▁ then ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ shall ▁ separate ▁ him ▁ that ▁ has ▁ the ▁ spot ▁ seven ▁ days;
▁ and ▁ saul ▁ said ▁ to ▁ his ▁ young ▁ man ▁ that ▁ was ▁ with ▁ him, ▁ lo, ▁ then, ▁ we ▁ will ▁ go; ▁ but ▁ what ▁ shall ▁ we ▁ bring ▁ the ▁ man ▁ of ▁ god? ▁ for ▁ the ▁ loaves ▁ are ▁ spent ▁ out ▁ of ▁ our ▁ vessels, ▁ and ▁ we ▁ have ▁ nothing ▁ more ▁ with ▁ us ▁ that ▁ belongs ▁ to ▁ us ▁ to ▁ bring ▁ to ▁ the ▁ man ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ i ▁ saw ▁ a ▁ very ▁ large ▁ number ▁ of ▁ birds ▁ and ▁ vultures ▁ gathered ▁ together ▁ upon ▁ a ▁ crag ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rock .
▁ and ▁ she ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ him,
▁ (for ▁ he ▁ who ▁ appointed ▁ peter ▁ to ▁ the ▁ apostleship ▁ of ▁ the ▁ circumcision ▁ appointed ▁ me ▁ also ▁ to ▁ the ▁ gentiles);
▁ in ▁ the ▁ same ▁ way ▁ also ▁ there ▁ are ▁ good ▁ works ▁ that ▁ are ▁ obvious, ▁ and ▁ those ▁ that ▁ are ▁ otherwise ▁ can't ▁ be ▁ hidden .
▁ and ▁ she ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ i ▁ know ▁ that ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ given ▁ you ▁ the ▁ land; ▁ for ▁ the ▁ fear ▁ of ▁ you ▁ has ▁ fallen ▁ upon ▁ us .
▁ then ▁ pharisees ▁ and ▁ scribes ▁ came ▁ to ▁ jesus ▁ from ▁ jerusalem, ▁ saying,
▁ this ▁ was ▁ done ▁ three ▁ times, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ were ▁ drawn ▁ up ▁ again ▁ into ▁ heaven .
▁ for ▁ god ▁ will ▁ save ▁ sion, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ cities ▁ of ▁ judea ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ built; ▁ and ▁ men ▁ shall ▁ dwell ▁ there, ▁ and ▁ inherit ▁ it .
▁ coming ▁ to ▁ us, ▁ and ▁ taking ▁ paul's ▁ belt, ▁ he ▁ bound ▁ his ▁ own ▁ feet ▁ and ▁ hands, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'thus ▁ says ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ spirit: ▁ 'so ▁ will ▁ the ▁ jews ▁ at ▁ jerusalem ▁ bind ▁ the ▁ man ▁ who ▁ owns ▁ this ▁ belt, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ deliver ▁ him ▁ into ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ the ▁ gentiles . ''
▁ i ▁ would ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ inform ▁ me ▁ concerning ▁ the ▁ stars ▁ which ▁ we ▁ see ▁ in ▁ the ▁ firmament, ▁ and ▁ tell ▁ me ▁ why ▁ it ▁ is ▁ that ▁ we ▁ cease ▁ to ▁ see ▁ them ▁ when ▁ the ▁ sun ▁ hath ▁ risen .
▁ remember ▁ us, ▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ with ▁ the ▁ favour ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ people: ▁ visit ▁ us ▁ with ▁ thy ▁ salvation;
▁ merchandise ▁ of ▁ gold, ▁ silver, ▁ precious ▁ stones, ▁ pearls, ▁ fine ▁ linen, ▁ purple, ▁ silk, ▁ scarlet, ▁ all ▁ expensive ▁ wood, ▁ every ▁ vessel ▁ of ▁ ivory, ▁ every ▁ vessel ▁ made ▁ of ▁ most ▁ precious ▁ wood, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ brass, ▁ and ▁ iron, ▁ and ▁ marble;
▁ the ▁ ungodly ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ driven ▁ away ▁ in ▁ his ▁ wickedness: ▁ but ▁ he ▁ who ▁ is ▁ secure ▁ in ▁ his ▁ own ▁ holiness ▁ is ▁ just .
▁ my ▁ soul ▁ has ▁ thirsted ▁ for ▁ the ▁ living ▁ god: ▁ when ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ come ▁ and ▁ appear ▁ before ▁ god?
▁ the ▁ grace ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ be ▁ with ▁ you ▁ all . ▁ amen .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ he ▁ that ▁ prepared ▁ light, ▁ and ▁ formed ▁ darkness; ▁ who ▁ make ▁ peace, ▁ and ▁ create ▁ evil; ▁ i ▁ am ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ does ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ on ▁ the ▁ seventh ▁ day, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ shave ▁ off ▁ all ▁ his ▁ hair, ▁ his ▁ head ▁ and ▁ his ▁ beard, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ eye-brows, ▁ even ▁ all ▁ his ▁ hair ▁ shall ▁ he ▁ shave; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ wash ▁ his ▁ garments, ▁ and ▁ wash ▁ his ▁ body ▁ with ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ clean .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ departed ▁ from ▁ the ▁ graves ▁ of ▁ lust, ▁ and ▁ encamped ▁ in ▁ aseroth .
▁ and ▁ 'the ▁ righteous ▁ man ▁ declareth ▁ the ▁ faith ▁ which ▁ is ▁ manifest
▁ if, ▁ however, ▁ she ▁ shall ▁ bear ▁ thee ▁ a ▁ daughter, ▁ live ▁ not ▁ with ▁ her, ▁ but ▁ cast ▁ her ▁ forth ▁ from ▁ thy ▁ house,
▁ my ▁ brethren ▁ have ▁ stood ▁ aloof ▁ from ▁ me; ▁ they ▁ have ▁ recognized ▁ strangers ▁ rather ▁ than ▁ me: ▁ and ▁ my ▁ friends ▁ have ▁ become ▁ pitiless .
▁ and ▁ saul ▁ departed ▁ to ▁ his ▁ house ▁ to ▁ gabaa; ▁ and ▁ there ▁ went ▁ with ▁ saul ▁ mighty ▁ men ▁ whose ▁ hearts ▁ god ▁ had ▁ touched .
▁ i ▁ command ▁ you ▁ therefore ▁ before ▁ god ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ, ▁ who ▁ will ▁ judge ▁ the ▁ living ▁ and ▁ the ▁ dead ▁ at ▁ his ▁ appearing ▁ and ▁ his ▁ kingdom:
▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ there ▁ with ▁ us ▁ a ▁ young ▁ man, ▁ a ▁ hebrew ▁ servant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ captain ▁ of ▁ the ▁ guard; ▁ and ▁ we ▁ related ▁ to ▁ him ▁ , ▁ and ▁ he ▁ interpreted ▁ to ▁ us .
▁ and ▁ abessa ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ saruia ▁ helped ▁ him ▁ and ▁ smote ▁ the ▁ philistine, ▁ and ▁ slew ▁ him . ▁ then ▁ the ▁ men ▁ of ▁ david ▁ swore, ▁ saying, ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ any ▁ longer ▁ go ▁ out ▁ with ▁ us ▁ to ▁ battle, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ quench ▁ the ▁ lamp ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ was ▁ as ▁ a ▁ man ▁ that ▁ hears ▁ not, ▁ and ▁ who ▁ has ▁ no ▁ reproofs ▁ in ▁ his ▁ mouth .
▁ for ▁ if ▁ we ▁ live, ▁ we ▁ live ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord . ▁ or ▁ if ▁ we ▁ die, ▁ we ▁ die ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord . ▁ if ▁ therefore ▁ we ▁ live ▁ or ▁ die, ▁ we ▁ are ▁ the ▁ lord's .
▁ it ▁ happened, ▁ when ▁ he ▁ went ▁ into ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ one ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rulers ▁ of ▁ the ▁ pharisees ▁ on ▁ a ▁ sabbath ▁ to ▁ eat ▁ bread, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ were ▁ watching ▁ him .
▁ jesus ▁ came ▁ and ▁ touched ▁ them ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'get ▁ up, ▁ and ▁ don't ▁ be ▁ afraid . '
▁ be ▁ not ▁ hasty ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ tongue, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ deeds ▁ slack ▁ and ▁ remiss .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ tills ▁ his ▁ own ▁ land ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ satisfied ▁ with ▁ bread: ▁ but ▁ he ▁ that ▁ follows ▁ idleness ▁ shall ▁ have ▁ plenty ▁ of ▁ poverty .
▁ if ▁ you ▁ only ▁ greet ▁ your ▁ friends, ▁ what ▁ more ▁ do ▁ you ▁ do ▁ than ▁ others? ▁ don't ▁ even ▁ the ▁ tax ▁ collectors ▁ do ▁ the ▁ same?
▁ then ▁ they ▁ took ▁ counsel ▁ together, ▁ saying, ▁ 'let ▁ us ▁ relate ▁ the ▁ matter ▁ to ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ man ▁ apa ▁ colluthus, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ a ▁ great ▁ one ▁ among ▁ men; ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ reveal ▁ the ▁ matter ▁ to ▁ him ▁ (in ▁ its ▁ true ▁ light), ▁ and ▁ he ▁ will ▁ not ▁ hide ▁ the ▁ business ▁ from ▁ him'
▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ eat ▁ it ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ year ▁ by ▁ year ▁ in ▁ the ▁ place ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god ▁ shall ▁ choose, ▁ thou ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ house .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ causes ▁ upright ▁ men ▁ to ▁ err ▁ in ▁ an ▁ evil ▁ way, ▁ himself ▁ shall ▁ fall ▁ into ▁ destruction: ▁ transgressor ▁ also ▁ shall ▁ pass ▁ by ▁ prosperity, ▁ but ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ enter ▁ into ▁ it .
▁ but ▁ they ▁ disobeyed, ▁ and ▁ provoked ▁ his ▁ holy ▁ spirit: ▁ so ▁ he ▁ turned ▁ to ▁ be ▁ an ▁ enemy, ▁ he ▁ himself ▁ contended ▁ against ▁ them .
▁ for ▁ they ▁ went ▁ a ▁ whoring ▁ after ▁ other ▁ gods, ▁ and ▁ worshipped ▁ them; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ turned ▁ quickly ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ way ▁ in ▁ which ▁ their ▁ fathers ▁ walked ▁ to ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ they ▁ did ▁ not ▁ so .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ ways ▁ of ▁ these ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ made ▁ desolate: ▁ the ▁ terror ▁ of ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ has ▁ been ▁ made ▁ to ▁ cease, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ covenant ▁ with ▁ these ▁ is ▁ taken ▁ away, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ by ▁ no ▁ means ▁ deem ▁ them ▁ men .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ delivered ▁ them ▁ into ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ their ▁ enemies; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ that ▁ hated ▁ them ▁ ruled ▁ over ▁ them .
▁ for ▁ we ▁ know ▁ that ▁ the ▁ law ▁ is ▁ spiritual, ▁ but ▁ i ▁ am ▁ fleshly, ▁ sold ▁ under ▁ sin .
▁ then ▁ they ▁ laid ▁ their ▁ hands ▁ on ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ received ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ spirit .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ took ▁ us, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ came ▁ forth ▁ from ▁ our ▁ house ▁ one ▁ night,
▁ and ▁ i ▁ remained ▁ with ▁ them ▁ for ▁ a ▁ few ▁ days .
▁ oh ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ wouldest ▁ slay ▁ the ▁ wicked, ▁ o ▁ god; ▁ depart ▁ from ▁ me, ▁ ye ▁ men ▁ of ▁ blood .
▁ when ▁ he ▁ had ▁ come, ▁ the ▁ jews ▁ who ▁ had ▁ come ▁ down ▁ from ▁ jerusalem ▁ stood ▁ around ▁ him, ▁ bringing ▁ against ▁ him ▁ many ▁ and ▁ grievous ▁ charges ▁ which ▁ they ▁ could ▁ not ▁ prove,
▁ judge ▁ for ▁ yourselves . ▁ is ▁ it ▁ appropriate ▁ that ▁ a ▁ woman ▁ pray ▁ to ▁ god ▁ unveiled?
▁ and ▁ delivered ▁ righteous ▁ lot, ▁ who ▁ was ▁ very ▁ distressed ▁ by ▁ the ▁ lustful ▁ life ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wicked
▁ for ▁ circumcision ▁ indeed ▁ profits, ▁ if ▁ you ▁ are ▁ a ▁ doer ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ but ▁ if ▁ you ▁ are ▁ a ▁ transgressor ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ your ▁ circumcision ▁ has ▁ become ▁ uncircumcision .
▁ let ▁ us ▁ bring ▁ as ▁ an ▁ offering ▁ (to ▁ him) ▁ our ▁ life ▁ of ▁ self-denial .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ saw ▁ the ▁ tears ▁ of ▁ the ▁ christ ▁ which ▁ fell ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ body ▁ of ▁ the ▁ blessed ▁ apa ▁ cyrus; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ christ ▁ turned ▁ away ▁ and ▁ departed ▁ by ▁ the ▁ door ▁ of ▁ the ▁ abode .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ duke ▁ made ▁ (his ▁ men) ▁ to ▁ inflict ▁ gashes ▁ in ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ apa ▁ victor, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ made ▁ them ▁ to ▁ stretch ▁ him ▁ out ▁ with ▁ thongs ▁ (of ▁ leather)
▁ now ▁ when ▁ jesus ▁ came ▁ into ▁ the ▁ parts ▁ of ▁ caesarea ▁ philippi, ▁ he ▁ asked ▁ his ▁ disciples, ▁ saying, ▁ 'who ▁ do ▁ men ▁ say ▁ that ▁ i, ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ man, ▁ am?'
▁ for ▁ i ▁ will ▁ show ▁ him ▁ how ▁ many ▁ things ▁ he ▁ must ▁ suffer ▁ for ▁ my ▁ name's ▁ sake . '
▁ thus ▁ paul ▁ went ▁ out ▁ from ▁ among ▁ them .
▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ thief ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ cross ▁ went ▁ into ▁ paradise .
▁ and ▁ that ▁ which ▁ is ▁ left ▁ of ▁ the ▁ oil ▁ which ▁ is ▁ on ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ put ▁ on ▁ the ▁ head ▁ of ▁ him ▁ that ▁ is ▁ purged, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ priest ▁ shall ▁ make ▁ atonement ▁ for ▁ him ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ i ▁ now ▁ rejoice, ▁ not ▁ that ▁ you ▁ were ▁ made ▁ sorry, ▁ but ▁ that ▁ you ▁ were ▁ made ▁ sorry ▁ to ▁ repentance . ▁ for ▁ you ▁ were ▁ made ▁ sorry ▁ in ▁ a ▁ godly ▁ way, ▁ that ▁ you ▁ might ▁ suffer ▁ loss ▁ by ▁ us ▁ in ▁ nothing .
▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ prosperity ▁ there ▁ is ▁ a ▁ forgetfulness ▁ of ▁ affliction: ▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day ▁ of ▁ affliction ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ more ▁ remembrance ▁ of ▁ prosperity .
▁ and ▁ ruth ▁ said ▁ to ▁ her, ▁ all ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ say, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ do .
▁ i ▁ thank ▁ my ▁ god ▁ always, ▁ making ▁ mention ▁ of ▁ you ▁ in ▁ my ▁ prayers,
▁ thine ▁ own ▁ friend, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ father's ▁ friend, ▁ forsake ▁ not; ▁ and ▁ when ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ in ▁ distress ▁ go ▁ not ▁ into ▁ thy ▁ brother's ▁ house: ▁ better ▁ is ▁ a ▁ friend ▁ that ▁ is ▁ near ▁ than ▁ a ▁ brother ▁ living ▁ far ▁ off .
▁ a ▁ prudent ▁ man ▁ is ▁ the ▁ crown ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wise: ▁ but ▁ the ▁ occupation ▁ of ▁ fools ▁ is ▁ evil .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ thank ▁ him ▁ who ▁ enabled ▁ me, ▁ christ ▁ jesus ▁ our ▁ lord, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ counted ▁ me ▁ faithful, ▁ appointing ▁ me ▁ to ▁ service;
▁ he ▁ vieweth ▁ the ▁ power ▁ of ▁ the ▁ height ▁ of ▁ heaven; ▁ and ▁ all ▁ men ▁ are ▁ but ▁ earth ▁ and ▁ ashes .
▁ and ▁ charge ▁ joshua, ▁ and ▁ strengthen ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ encourage ▁ him; ▁ for ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ go ▁ before ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ this ▁ people, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ give ▁ them ▁ the ▁ inheritance ▁ of ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ seen .
▁ and ▁ an ▁ angel ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ appeared ▁ to ▁ him ▁ in ▁ flaming ▁ fire ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ bush, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ sees ▁ that ▁ the ▁ bush ▁ burns ▁ with ▁ fire, ▁ but ▁ the ▁ bush ▁ was ▁ not ▁ consumed .
▁ now ▁ when ▁ jesus ▁ heard ▁ this, ▁ he ▁ withdrew ▁ from ▁ there ▁ in ▁ a ▁ boat, ▁ to ▁ a ▁ deserted ▁ place ▁ apart . ▁ when ▁ the ▁ multitudes ▁ heard ▁ it, ▁ they ▁ followed ▁ him ▁ on ▁ foot ▁ from ▁ the ▁ cities .
▁ the ▁ ways ▁ of ▁ her ▁ household ▁ are ▁ careful, ▁ and ▁ she ▁ eats ▁ not ▁ the ▁ bread ▁ of ▁ idleness .
▁ how ▁ he ▁ withstood ▁ thee ▁ in ▁ the ▁ way, ▁ and ▁ harassed ▁ thy ▁ rear, ▁ even ▁ those ▁ that ▁ were ▁ weary ▁ behind ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ hunger ▁ and ▁ wast ▁ weary; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ did ▁ not ▁ fear ▁ god .
▁ and ▁ samuel ▁ took ▁ a ▁ stone, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ it ▁ up ▁ between ▁ massephath ▁ and ▁ the ▁ old ▁ city; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ called ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ it ▁ abenezer, ▁ stone ▁ of ▁ the ▁ helper; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ hitherto ▁ has ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ helped ▁ us .
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ ephraim ▁ and ▁ manasse, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ juda ▁ to ▁ the ▁ farthest ▁ sea;
▁ for ▁ in ▁ him ▁ all ▁ the ▁ fullness ▁ of ▁ the ▁ godhead ▁ dwells ▁ bodily,
▁ the ▁ heavens ▁ have ▁ declared ▁ his ▁ righteousness, ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ people ▁ have ▁ seen ▁ his ▁ glory .
▁ wilt ▁ thou ▁ be ▁ startled ▁ at ▁ me, ▁ as ▁ at ▁ a ▁ leaf ▁ shaken ▁ by ▁ the ▁ wind? ▁ or ▁ wilt ▁ thou ▁ set ▁ thyself ▁ against ▁ me ▁ as ▁ against ▁ grass ▁ borne ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ breeze?
▁ i ▁ have ▁ seen, ▁ and ▁ have ▁ testified ▁ that ▁ this ▁ is ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god . '
▁ will ▁ a ▁ wise ▁ man ▁ give ▁ for ▁ answer ▁ a ▁ mere ▁ breath ▁ of ▁ wisdom? ▁ and ▁ does ▁ he ▁ fill ▁ up ▁ the ▁ pain ▁ of ▁ his ▁ belly,
▁ for ▁ without ▁ cause ▁ they ▁ have ▁ hid ▁ for ▁ me ▁ their ▁ destructive ▁ snare: ▁ without ▁ a ▁ cause ▁ they ▁ have ▁ reproached ▁ my ▁ soul .
▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ depths ▁ have ▁ i ▁ cried ▁ to ▁ thee, ▁ o ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ laban ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ better ▁ that ▁ i ▁ should ▁ give ▁ her ▁ to ▁ thee, ▁ than ▁ that ▁ i ▁ should ▁ give ▁ her ▁ to ▁ another ▁ man; ▁ dwell ▁ with ▁ me .
▁ all ▁ his ▁ acquaintances, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ women ▁ who ▁ followed ▁ with ▁ him ▁ from ▁ galilee, ▁ stood ▁ at ▁ a ▁ distance, ▁ watching ▁ these ▁ things .
▁ every ▁ beast ▁ parting ▁ the ▁ hoof ▁ and ▁ making ▁ divisions ▁ of ▁ two ▁ claws, ▁ and ▁ chewing ▁ the ▁ cud ▁ among ▁ beasts, ▁ these ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ eat .
▁ he ▁ seals ▁ up ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ every ▁ man, ▁ that ▁ every ▁ man ▁ may ▁ know ▁ his ▁ own ▁ weakness .

▁ grace ▁ to ▁ you ▁ and ▁ peace ▁ from ▁ god ▁ the ▁ father, ▁ and ▁ our ▁ lord ▁ jesus ▁ christ,
▁ and ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ took ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ it ▁ from ▁ abenezer ▁ to ▁ azotus .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ also ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ ‘my ▁ beloved ▁ brother ▁ pambo, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ sick ▁ this ▁ day . ▁ i ▁ beseech ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ do ▁ me ▁ the ▁ favour ▁ of ▁ praying ▁ for ▁ me ▁ until ▁ i ▁ journey ▁ over ▁ the ▁ road ▁ of ▁ fear ▁ and ▁ terror . '
▁ and ▁ he ▁ suspended ▁ a ▁ bell ▁ from ▁ his ▁ neck
▁ be ▁ not ▁ slow ▁ to ▁ visit ▁ the ▁ sick: ▁ fir ▁ that ▁ shall ▁ make ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ be ▁ beloved .
▁ for ▁ he ▁ has ▁ broken ▁ down ▁ the ▁ houses ▁ of ▁ many ▁ mighty ▁ men: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ has ▁ plundered ▁ an ▁ habitation, ▁ though ▁ he ▁ built ▁ it ▁ not .
▁ when ▁ they ▁ had ▁ come ▁ to ▁ capernaum, ▁ those ▁ who ▁ collected ▁ the ▁ didrachma ▁ coins ▁ came ▁ to ▁ peter, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'doesn't ▁ your ▁ teacher ▁ pay ▁ the ▁ didrachma?'
▁ give ▁ not ▁ thy ▁ wealth ▁ to ▁ women, ▁ nor ▁ thy ▁ mind ▁ and ▁ living ▁ to ▁ remorse . ▁ do ▁ all ▁ things ▁ with ▁ counsel: ▁ drink ▁ wine ▁ with ▁ counsel .
▁ jesus ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'if ▁ you ▁ want ▁ to ▁ be ▁ perfect, ▁ go, ▁ sell ▁ what ▁ you ▁ have, ▁ and ▁ give ▁ to ▁ the ▁ poor, ▁ and ▁ you ▁ will ▁ have ▁ treasure ▁ in ▁ heaven; ▁ and ▁ come, ▁ follow ▁ me . '
▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ shall ▁ say, ▁ why ▁ has ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ done ▁ thus ▁ to ▁ this ▁ land? ▁ what ▁ is ▁ this ▁ great ▁ fierceness ▁ of ▁ anger?
▁ and ▁ he ▁ giveth ▁ unto ▁ them ▁ consolation .
▁ he ▁ has ▁ calmed ▁ the ▁ sea ▁ with ▁ his ▁ might, ▁ and ▁ by ▁ his ▁ wisdom ▁ the ▁ whale ▁ has ▁ been ▁ overthrown .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ in ▁ that ▁ day, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ shall ▁ again ▁ shew ▁ his ▁ hand, ▁ to ▁ be ▁ zealous ▁ for ▁ the ▁ remnant ▁ that ▁ is ▁ left ▁ of ▁ the ▁ people, ▁ which ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ left ▁ by ▁ the ▁ assyrians, ▁ and ▁ that ▁ from ▁ egypt, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ the ▁ country ▁ of ▁ babylon, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ ethiopia, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ the ▁ elamites, ▁ and ▁ from ▁ the ▁ rising ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sun, ▁ and ▁ out ▁ of ▁ arabia .
▁ he ▁ causes ▁ all, ▁ the ▁ small ▁ and ▁ the ▁ great, ▁ the ▁ rich ▁ and ▁ the ▁ poor, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ free ▁ and ▁ the ▁ slave, ▁ to ▁ be ▁ given ▁ marks ▁ on ▁ their ▁ right ▁ hands, ▁ or ▁ on ▁ their ▁ foreheads;
▁ they ▁ said ▁ therefore ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'lord, ▁ always ▁ give ▁ us ▁ this ▁ bread . '
▁ as ▁ it ▁ happened ▁ in ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ noah, ▁ even ▁ so ▁ will ▁ it ▁ be ▁ also ▁ in ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ man .
▁ jesus ▁ answered ▁ them, ▁ 'isn't ▁ it ▁ written ▁ in ▁ your ▁ law, ▁ 'i ▁ said, ▁ you ▁ are ▁ gods?'
▁ no ▁ longer ▁ as ▁ a ▁ slave, ▁ but ▁ more ▁ than ▁ a ▁ slave, ▁ a ▁ beloved ▁ brother, ▁ especially ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ but ▁ how ▁ much ▁ rather ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ both ▁ in ▁ the ▁ flesh ▁ and ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ now ▁ he ▁ put ▁ the ▁ woman ▁ again ▁ into ▁ the ▁ boat ▁ in ▁ which ▁ he ▁ brought ▁ her,^ ▁ and ▁ he ▁ hid ▁ thirty-six ▁ 'holokottinoi' ▁ in ▁ the ▁ boat ▁. ▁. ▁. ▁ with ▁ her ▁ ;
▁ jesus ▁ looking ▁ at ▁ him ▁ loved ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'one ▁ thing ▁ you ▁ lack . ▁ go, ▁ sell ▁ whatever ▁ you ▁ have, ▁ and ▁ give ▁ to ▁ the ▁ poor, ▁ and ▁ you ▁ will ▁ have ▁ treasure ▁ in ▁ heaven; ▁ and ▁ come, ▁ follow ▁ me, ▁ taking ▁ up ▁ the ▁ cross . '
▁ every ▁ one ▁ who ▁ hates ▁ his ▁ poor ▁ brother ▁ shall ▁ also ▁ be ▁ far ▁ from ▁ friendship . ▁ good ▁ understanding ▁ will ▁ draw ▁ near ▁ to ▁ them ▁ that ▁ know ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ sensible ▁ man ▁ will ▁ find ▁ it . ▁ he ▁ that ▁ does ▁ much ▁ harm ▁ perfects ▁ mischief; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ that ▁ used ▁ provoking ▁ words ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ escape .
▁ for ▁ thou ▁ must ▁ of ▁ necessity ▁ endure ▁ manifold ▁ temptations .
▁ let ▁ them ▁ be ▁ as ▁ the ▁ grass ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house-tops, ▁ which ▁ withers ▁ before ▁ it ▁ is ▁ plucked ▁ up .
▁ now ▁ it ▁ happened, ▁ while ▁ the ▁ multitude ▁ pressed ▁ on ▁ him ▁ and ▁ heard ▁ the ▁ word ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ standing ▁ by ▁ the ▁ lake ▁ of ▁ gennesaret .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ said ▁ to ▁ moses, ▁ rise ▁ up ▁ early ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ stand ▁ before ▁ pharao: ▁ and ▁ behold, ▁ he ▁ will ▁ go ▁ forth ▁ to ▁ the ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ say ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ these ▁ things ▁ says ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ send ▁ away ▁ my ▁ people, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ serve ▁ me ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wilderness .
▁ we ▁ will ▁ go ▁ over ▁ armed ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ into ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ chanaan, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ give ▁ us ▁ our ▁ inheritance ▁ beyond ▁ jordan .
▁ and ▁ when ▁ we ▁ arrived ▁ at ▁ the ▁ shore ▁ on ▁ the ▁ ship ▁ my ▁ mother ▁ remained ▁ by ▁ herself ▁ on ▁ the ▁ ship, ▁ though ▁ for ▁ what ▁ purpose ▁ i ▁ know ▁ not . ▁ as ▁ for ▁ us ▁ our ▁ father ▁ took ▁ the ▁ two ▁ of ▁ us ▁ away, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ went ▁ on ▁ his ▁ way ▁ weeping .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ embarked ▁ with ▁ us ▁ in ▁ a ▁ ship ▁ wherein ▁ we ▁ sailed ▁ i ▁ know ▁ not ▁ whither .
▁ and ▁ samuel ▁ said ▁ to ▁ all ▁ israel, ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ hearkened ▁ to ▁ your ▁ voice ▁ in ▁ all ▁ things ▁ that ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ said ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ set ▁ a ▁ king ▁ over ▁ you .
▁ and ▁ dalida ▁ said ▁ to ▁ sampson, ▁ behold, ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ deceived ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ told ▁ me ▁ lies; ▁ tell ▁ me, ▁ i ▁ intreat ▁ thee, ▁ wherewith ▁ thou ▁ mayest ▁ be ▁ bound: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ said ▁ to ▁ her, ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ shouldest ▁ weave ▁ the ▁ seven ▁ locks ▁ of ▁ my ▁ head ▁ with ▁ the ▁ web, ▁ and ▁ shouldest ▁ fasten ▁ them ▁ with ▁ the ▁ pin ▁ into ▁ the ▁ wall, ▁ then ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ be ▁ weak ▁ as ▁ another ▁ man .
▁ it ▁ happened ▁ on ▁ one ▁ of ▁ those ▁ days, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ teaching; ▁ and ▁ there ▁ were ▁ pharisees ▁ and ▁ teachers ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law ▁ sitting ▁ by, ▁ who ▁ had ▁ come ▁ out ▁ of ▁ every ▁ village ▁ of ▁ galilee, ▁ judea, ▁ and ▁ jerusalem . ▁ the ▁ power ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ was ▁ with ▁ him ▁ to ▁ heal ▁ them .
▁ rightly, ▁ therefore, ▁ did ▁ the ▁ saviour ▁ ascribe ▁ blessing ▁ to ▁ those ▁ who ▁ afflict ▁ themselves ▁ so ▁ that ▁ the ▁ pleasures ▁ of ▁ this ▁ world ▁ may ▁ not ▁ prevail ▁ over ▁ them .
▁ i ▁ say ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ i ▁ have ▁ seen ▁ with ▁ my ▁ father; ▁ and ▁ you ▁ also ▁ do ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ you ▁ have ▁ seen ▁ with ▁ your ▁ father . '
▁ his ▁ burial ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ in ▁ peace: ▁ he ▁ has ▁ been ▁ removed ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ way .
▁ for ▁ when ▁ we ▁ were ▁ in ▁ the ▁ flesh, ▁ the ▁ sinful ▁ passions ▁ which ▁ were ▁ through ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ worked ▁ in ▁ our ▁ members ▁ to ▁ bring ▁ forth ▁ fruit ▁ to ▁ death .
▁ joshua ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ naue, ▁ who ▁ stands ▁ by ▁ thee, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ enter ▁ in ▁ there; ▁ do ▁ thou ▁ strengthen ▁ him, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ cause ▁ israel ▁ to ▁ inherit ▁ it .
▁...
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ called ▁ all ▁ israel, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ hear, ▁ israel, ▁ the ▁ ordinances ▁ and ▁ judgments, ▁ all ▁ that ▁ i ▁ speak ▁ in ▁ your ▁ ears ▁ this ▁ day, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ learn ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ observe ▁ to ▁ do ▁ them .
▁ he ▁ made ▁ known ▁ his ▁ ways ▁ to ▁ moses, ▁ his ▁ will ▁ to ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ for ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ has ▁ rejoiced, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ reins ▁ have ▁ been ▁ gladdened .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ declared ▁ unto ▁ him ▁ the ▁ things ▁ which ▁ had ▁ happened ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ and ▁ immediately ▁ he ▁ recognized ▁ that ▁ they ▁ were ▁ in ▁ truth ▁ his ▁ sons,
▁ they ▁ told ▁ her, ▁ 'woman, ▁ why ▁ are ▁ you ▁ weeping?' ▁ she ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ 'because ▁ they ▁ have ▁ taken ▁ away ▁ my ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ don't ▁ know ▁ where ▁ they ▁ have ▁ laid ▁ him . '
▁ peter ▁ said, ▁ 'look, ▁ we ▁ have ▁ left ▁ everything, ▁ and ▁ followed ▁ you . '
▁ and ▁ they ▁ shall ▁ ask ▁ thee ▁ how ▁ thou ▁ doest, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ give ▁ thee ▁ two ▁ presents ▁ of ▁ bread, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shall ▁ receive ▁ them ▁ of ▁ their ▁ hand .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ what ▁ was ▁ the ▁ word ▁ that ▁ was ▁ spoken ▁ to ▁ thee? ▁ i ▁ pray ▁ thee ▁ hide ▁ it ▁ not ▁ from ▁ me: ▁ may ▁ god ▁ do ▁ these ▁ things ▁ to ▁ thee, ▁ and ▁ more ▁ also, ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ hide ▁ from ▁ me ▁ any ▁ thing ▁ of ▁ all ▁ the ▁ words ▁ that ▁ were ▁ spoken ▁ to ▁ thee ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ ears .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ saw ▁ a ▁ being ▁ of ▁ light ▁ before ▁ me,
▁ i ▁ must ▁ work ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ him ▁ who ▁ sent ▁ me, ▁ while ▁ it ▁ is ▁ day . ▁ the ▁ night ▁ is ▁ coming, ▁ when ▁ no ▁ one ▁ can ▁ work .
▁ therefore, ▁ we ▁ are ▁ always ▁ confident ▁ and ▁ know ▁ that ▁ while ▁ we ▁ are ▁ at ▁ home ▁ in ▁ the ▁ body, ▁ we ▁ are ▁ absent ▁ from ▁ the ▁ lord;
▁ how ▁ long ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ take ▁ counsel ▁ in ▁ my ▁ soul, ▁ having ▁ sorrows ▁ in ▁ my ▁ heart ▁ daily? ▁ how ▁ long ▁ shall ▁ my ▁ enemy ▁ be ▁ exalted ▁ over ▁ me?
▁ praise ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ ye ▁ servants ▁ of ▁ his, ▁ praise, ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ how ▁ long, ▁ o ▁ lord? ▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ until ▁ cities ▁ be ▁ deserted ▁ by ▁ reason ▁ of ▁ their ▁ not ▁ being ▁ inhabited, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ houses ▁ by ▁ reason ▁ of ▁ there ▁ being ▁ no ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ land ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ left ▁ desolate .
▁ therefore ▁ a ▁ curse ▁ shall ▁ consume ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ because ▁ the ▁ inhabitants ▁ thereof ▁ have ▁ sinned: ▁ therefore ▁ the ▁ dwellers ▁ in ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ poor, ▁ and ▁ few ▁ men ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ left .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ man ▁ dipped ▁ his ▁ finger ▁ in ▁ this ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ made ▁ the ▁ sign ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cross ▁ on ▁ the ▁ youth ▁ in ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ the ▁ father, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ ghost .
▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ sojourn ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ tabernacle? ▁ and ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ dwell ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ holy ▁ mountain?
▁...
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ besiege ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ build ▁ works ▁ against ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ throw ▁ up ▁ a ▁ mound ▁ round ▁ about ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ pitch ▁ camps ▁ against ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ up ▁ engines ▁ round ▁ about .
▁ but ▁ job ▁ answered ▁ and ▁ said,
▁ by ▁ day ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ will ▁ command ▁ his ▁ mercy, ▁ and ▁ manifest ▁ it ▁ by ▁ night: ▁ with ▁ me ▁ is ▁ prayer ▁ to ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ my ▁ life .
▁ why ▁ dost ▁ thou ▁ not ▁ wear ▁ fine ▁ apparel ▁ and ▁ put ▁ on ▁ beautiful ▁ raiment?
▁ if ▁ i ▁ go ▁ forth ▁ into ▁ the ▁ plain, ▁ then ▁ behold ▁ the ▁ slain ▁ by ▁ the ▁ sword! ▁ and ▁ if ▁ i ▁ enter ▁ into ▁ the ▁ city, ▁ then ▁ behold ▁ the ▁ distress ▁ of ▁ famine! ▁ for ▁ priest ▁ and ▁ prophet ▁ have ▁ gone ▁ to ▁ a ▁ land ▁ which ▁ they ▁ knew ▁ not .
▁ and ▁ for ▁ all ▁ these ▁ things ▁ faithless ▁ juda ▁ turned ▁ not ▁ to ▁ me ▁ with ▁ all ▁ her ▁ heart, ▁ but ▁ falsely .
▁ who ▁ will ▁ speak ▁ to ▁ you ▁ words ▁ by ▁ which ▁ you ▁ will ▁ be ▁ saved, ▁ you ▁ and ▁ all ▁ your ▁ house . '
▁ explain ▁ to ▁ me ▁ why ▁ it ▁ is ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ in ▁ this ▁ disgraceful ▁ state .
▁ these ▁ have ▁ carried ▁ away ▁ the ▁ dear ▁ beloved ▁ children ▁ of ▁ the ▁ widow, ▁ and ▁ left ▁ her ▁ that ▁ was ▁ alone ▁ desolate ▁ without ▁ daughters .
▁ establish ▁ with ▁ me ▁ a ▁ token ▁ for ▁ good; ▁ and ▁ let ▁ them ▁ that ▁ hate ▁ me ▁ see ▁ it ▁ and ▁ be ▁ ashamed; ▁ because ▁ thou, ▁ o ▁ lord, ▁ hast ▁ helped ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ comforted ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ remnant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ strong ▁ bows ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ kedar ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ small: ▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ has ▁ spoken ▁ it .
▁ for ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ dost ▁ not ▁ my ▁ son ▁ is ▁ in ▁ danger ▁ of ▁ dying, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ believe ▁ by ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ if ▁ he ▁ were ▁ to ▁ make ▁ the ▁ sign ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cross ▁ over ▁ my ▁ son ▁ he ▁ would ▁ find ▁ relief ▁ immediately .
▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ keep ▁ this ▁ commandment, ▁ for ▁ on ▁ this ▁ day ▁ will ▁ i ▁ bring ▁ out ▁ your ▁ force ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt; ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ make ▁ this ▁ day ▁ a ▁ perpetual ▁ ordinance ▁ for ▁ you ▁ throughout ▁ your ▁ generations .
▁ and ▁ after ▁ him ▁ eleanan ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ his ▁ uncle, ▁ son ▁ of ▁ dudi ▁ who ▁ was ▁ among ▁ the ▁ three ▁ mighty ▁ men ▁ with ▁ david; ▁ and ▁ when ▁ he ▁ defied ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ they ▁ were ▁ gathered ▁ there ▁ to ▁ war, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ men ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ went ▁ up .
▁ for ▁ it ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ call ▁ to ▁ wisdom, ▁ and ▁ utter ▁ thy ▁ voice ▁ for ▁ understanding;
▁ and ▁ that ▁ takes ▁ away ▁ the ▁ spirits ▁ of ▁ princes; ▁ to ▁ him ▁ that ▁ is ▁ terrible ▁ among ▁ the ▁ kings ▁ of ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ having ▁ been ▁ made ▁ perfect, ▁ he ▁ became ▁ to ▁ all ▁ of ▁ those ▁ who ▁ obey ▁ him ▁ the ▁ author ▁ of ▁ eternal ▁ salvation,
▁ our ▁ feet ▁ stood ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ courts, ▁ o ▁ jerusalem .
▁ for ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ come ▁ forth ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ the ▁ prisoners ▁ to ▁ reign, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ also ▁ that ▁ was ▁ in ▁ his ▁ kingdom ▁ has ▁ become ▁ poor .
▁ and ▁ their ▁ borders ▁ were ▁ jazel, ▁ and ▁ chasaloth, ▁ and ▁ sunam,
▁ as ▁ he ▁ came ▁ forth ▁ naked ▁ from ▁ his ▁ mother's ▁ womb, ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ return ▁ back ▁ as ▁ he ▁ came, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ receive ▁ nothing ▁ for ▁ his ▁ labour, ▁ that ▁ it ▁ should ▁ go ▁ with ▁ him ▁ in ▁ his ▁ hand .
▁ yet ▁ knowing ▁ that ▁ a ▁ man ▁ is ▁ not ▁ justified ▁ by ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law ▁ but ▁ through ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ jesus ▁ christ, ▁ even ▁ we ▁ believed ▁ in ▁ christ ▁ jesus, ▁ that ▁ we ▁ might ▁ be ▁ justified ▁ by ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ christ, ▁ and ▁ not ▁ by ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law, ▁ because ▁ no ▁ flesh ▁ will ▁ be ▁ justified ▁ by ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law .
▁ and ▁ his ▁ mother ▁ made ▁ him ▁ a ▁ little ▁ doublet, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ it ▁ to ▁ him ▁ from ▁ year ▁ to ▁ year, ▁ in ▁ her ▁ going ▁ up ▁ in ▁ company ▁ with ▁ her ▁ husband ▁ to ▁ offer ▁ the ▁ yearly ▁ sacrifice .
▁ the ▁ word ▁ is ▁ very ▁ near ▁ thee, ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ mouth, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ heart, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ hands ▁ to ▁ do ▁ it .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ send ▁ away ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ god ▁ to ▁ ascalon; ▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ when ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ god ▁ went ▁ into ▁ ascalon, ▁ that ▁ the ▁ men ▁ of ▁ ascalon ▁ cried ▁ out, ▁ saying, ▁ why ▁ have ▁ ye ▁ brought ▁ back ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ of ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ to ▁ us, ▁ to ▁ kill ▁ us ▁ and ▁ our ▁ people?
▁ for ▁ he ▁ has ▁ forsaken ▁ his ▁ people ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ because ▁ their ▁ land ▁ is ▁ filled ▁ as ▁ at ▁ the ▁ beginning ▁ with ▁ divinations, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ the ▁ philistines, ▁ and ▁ many ▁ strange ▁ children ▁ were ▁ born ▁ to ▁ them .
▁ he ▁ led ▁ them ▁ out ▁ as ▁ far ▁ as ▁ bethany, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ lifted ▁ up ▁ his ▁ hands, ▁ and ▁ blessed ▁ them .
▁ be ▁ thou ▁ exalted, ▁ o ▁ god, ▁ above ▁ the ▁ heavens; ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ glory ▁ above ▁ all ▁ the ▁ earth .
▁ a ▁ wise ▁ servant ▁ calms ▁ a ▁ man's ▁ anger; ▁ but ▁ who ▁ can ▁ endure ▁ a ▁ faint-hearted ▁ man?
▁ but ▁ if ▁ they ▁ should ▁ say ▁ thus ▁ to ▁ us, ▁ come ▁ up ▁ to ▁ us; ▁ then ▁ will ▁ we ▁ go ▁ up, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ delivered ▁ them ▁ into ▁ our ▁ hands; ▁ this ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ a ▁ sign ▁ to ▁ us .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ observes ▁ the ▁ day, ▁ observes ▁ it ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ who ▁ does ▁ not ▁ observe ▁ the ▁ day, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ he ▁ does ▁ not ▁ observe ▁ it . ▁ he ▁ who ▁ eats, ▁ eats ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ gives ▁ god ▁ thanks . ▁ he ▁ who ▁ doesn't ▁ eat, ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ he ▁ doesn't ▁ eat, ▁ and ▁ gives ▁ god ▁ thanks .
▁ and ▁ apa ▁ victor ▁ answered ▁ and ▁ said,
▁ i ▁ have ▁ longed ▁ after ▁ thy ▁ salvation, ▁ o ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ law ▁ is ▁ my ▁ meditation .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ after ▁ this ▁ that ▁ he ▁ loved ▁ a ▁ woman ▁ in ▁ alsorech, ▁ and ▁ her ▁ name ▁ was ▁ dalida .
▁ her ▁ neighbors ▁ and ▁ her ▁ relatives ▁ heard ▁ that ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ had ▁ magnified ▁ his ▁ mercy ▁ towards ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ rejoiced ▁ with ▁ her .
▁ and ▁ we ▁ inherited ▁ that ▁ land ▁ at ▁ that ▁ time ▁ from ▁ aroer, ▁ which ▁ is ▁ by ▁ the ▁ border ▁ of ▁ the ▁ torrent ▁ arnon, ▁ and ▁ half ▁ the ▁ mount ▁ of ▁ galaad; ▁ and ▁ i ▁ gave ▁ his ▁ cities ▁ to ▁ ruben ▁ and ▁ to ▁ gad .
▁ and ▁ while ▁ he ▁ was ▁ worshipping ▁ nasarach ▁ his ▁ country's ▁ god ▁ in ▁ the ▁ house, ▁ adramelech ▁ and ▁ sarasar ▁ his ▁ sons ▁ smote ▁ him ▁ with ▁ swords; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ escaped ▁ into ▁ armenia: ▁ and ▁ asordan ▁ his ▁ son ▁ reigned ▁ in ▁ his ▁ stead .
▁ first, ▁ i ▁ thank ▁ my ▁ god ▁ through ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ for ▁ all ▁ of ▁ you, ▁ that ▁ your ▁ faith ▁ is ▁ proclaimed ▁ throughout ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ world .
▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ give ▁ subtlety ▁ to ▁ the ▁ simple, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ the ▁ young ▁ man ▁ discernment ▁ and ▁ understanding .
▁ for ▁ out ▁ of ▁ jerusalem ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ a ▁ remnant, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ saved ▁ ones ▁ out ▁ of ▁ mount ▁ sion: ▁ the ▁ zeal ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ of ▁ hosts ▁ shall ▁ perform ▁ this .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ man ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ jacob, ▁ 'they ▁ shall ▁ no ▁ more ▁ call ▁ thee ▁ jacob, ▁ but ▁ israel, ▁ which ▁ is ▁ the ▁ name ▁ which ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ have; ▁ for ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ prevailed ▁ with ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ (shalt ▁ be) ▁ mighty ▁ with ▁ men'
▁ neither ▁ hast ▁ thou ▁ purchased ▁ for ▁ me ▁ victims ▁ for ▁ silver, ▁ neither ▁ have ▁ i ▁ desired ▁ the ▁ fat ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ sacrifices: ▁ but ▁ thou ▁ didst ▁ stand ▁ before ▁ me ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ sins, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ iniquities .
▁ foolish ▁ galatians, ▁ who ▁ has ▁ bewitched ▁ you ▁ not ▁ to ▁ obey ▁ the ▁ truth, ▁ before ▁ whose ▁ eyes ▁ jesus ▁ christ ▁ was ▁ openly ▁ set ▁ forth ▁ among ▁ you ▁ as ▁ crucified?

▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ taken ▁ away ▁ from ▁ her ▁ (the ▁ glory) ▁ of ▁ humanity .
▁ therefore, ▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ days ▁ come, ▁ saith ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ when ▁ this ▁ place ▁ shall ▁ no ▁ more ▁ be ▁ called, ▁ the ▁ fall ▁ and ▁ burial-place ▁ of ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ ennom, ▁ but, ▁ the ▁ burial-place ▁ of ▁ slaughter .

▁ when ▁ we ▁ had ▁ sailed ▁ slowly ▁ many ▁ days, ▁ and ▁ had ▁ come ▁ with ▁ difficulty ▁ opposite ▁ cnidus, ▁ the ▁ wind ▁ not ▁ allowing ▁ us ▁ further, ▁ we ▁ sailed ▁ under ▁ the ▁ lee ▁ of ▁ crete, ▁ opposite ▁ salmone .
▁ and ▁ who ▁ would ▁ say . ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ broken ▁ a ▁ custom ▁ which ▁ was ▁ seemly .
▁ and ▁ john ▁ answered ▁ (and ▁ said), ▁ 'my ▁ lord, ▁ explain ▁ to ▁ me ▁ the ▁ order ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cherubim, ▁ which ▁ is ▁ exceedingly ▁ terrible . '
▁ on ▁ that ▁ very ▁ day ▁ entered ▁ noe, ▁ sem, ▁ cham, ▁ japheth, ▁ the ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ noe, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ wife ▁ of ▁ noe, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ three ▁ wives ▁ of ▁ his ▁ sons ▁ with ▁ him ▁ into ▁ the ▁ ark .
▁ the ▁ mountains ▁ were ▁ shaken ▁ before ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ eloi, ▁ this ▁ sina ▁ before ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel .
▁ for ▁ thy ▁ name ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ called ▁ of ▁ god ▁ for ▁ ever ▁ the ▁ peace ▁ of ▁ righteousness, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ glory ▁ of ▁ god's ▁ worship .
▁ those ▁ servants ▁ went ▁ out ▁ into ▁ the ▁ highways, ▁ and ▁ gathered ▁ together ▁ as ▁ many ▁ as ▁ they ▁ found, ▁ both ▁ bad ▁ and ▁ good . ▁ the ▁ wedding ▁ was ▁ filled ▁ with ▁ guests .
▁ whereas ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ set ▁ boundaries ▁ between ▁ us ▁ and ▁ you, ▁ even ▁ jordan, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ have ▁ no ▁ portion ▁ in ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ so ▁ your ▁ sons ▁ shall ▁ alienate ▁ our ▁ sons, ▁ that ▁ they ▁ should ▁ not ▁ worship ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ moreover ▁ there ▁ are ▁ three ▁ things ▁ impossible ▁ for ▁ me ▁ to ▁ comprehend, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ fourth ▁ i ▁ know ▁ not:
▁ remember ▁ the ▁ commandments, ▁ and ▁ bear ▁ no ▁ malice ▁ to ▁ thy ▁ neighbour: ▁ remember ▁ the ▁ covenant ▁ of ▁ the ▁ highest, ▁ and ▁ wink ▁ at ▁ ignorance .
▁ deliver ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ rescue ▁ me ▁ from ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ strange ▁ children, ▁ whose ▁ mouth ▁ has ▁ spoken ▁ vanity, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ right ▁ hand ▁ is ▁ a ▁ right ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ iniquity;
▁ and ▁ david ▁ said ▁ to ▁ nathan, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ sinned ▁ against ▁ the ▁ lord . ▁ and ▁ nathan ▁ said ▁ to ▁ david, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ put ▁ away ▁ thy ▁ sin; ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ die .
▁ he ▁ has ▁ laboured ▁ unprofitably ▁ and ▁ in ▁ vain, ▁ for ▁ wealth ▁ of ▁ which ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ taste: ▁ it ▁ is ▁ as ▁ a ▁ lean ▁ thing, ▁ unfit ▁ for ▁ food, ▁ which ▁ he ▁ cannot ▁ swallow .
▁ this ▁ is ▁ the ▁ dealing ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ with ▁ those ▁ who ▁ falsely ▁ accuse ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ speak ▁ evil ▁ against ▁ my ▁ soul .
▁ the ▁ lord ▁ giveth ▁ unto ▁ every ▁ man ▁ according ▁ to ▁ what ▁ he ▁ hath ▁ suffered .
▁ and ▁ jonathan, ▁ saul's ▁ son, ▁ loved ▁ david ▁ much: ▁ and ▁ jonathan ▁ told ▁ david, ▁ saying, ▁ saul ▁ seeks ▁ to ▁ kill ▁ thee: ▁ take ▁ heed ▁ to ▁ thyself ▁ therefore ▁ to-morrow ▁ morning, ▁ and ▁ hide ▁ thyself, ▁ and ▁ dwell ▁ in ▁ secret .
▁ but ▁ evil ▁ men ▁ said, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ this ▁ man ▁ that ▁ shall ▁ save ▁ us? ▁ and ▁ they ▁ despised ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ brought ▁ him ▁ no ▁ gifts .
▁ paul ▁ summoned ▁ one ▁ of ▁ the ▁ centurions, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'bring ▁ this ▁ young ▁ man ▁ to ▁ the ▁ commanding ▁ officer, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ has ▁ something ▁ to ▁ tell ▁ him . '
▁ 'for ▁ the ▁ kingdom ▁ of ▁ heaven ▁ is ▁ like ▁ a ▁ man ▁ who ▁ was ▁ the ▁ master ▁ of ▁ a ▁ household, ▁ who ▁ went ▁ out ▁ early ▁ in ▁ the ▁ morning ▁ to ▁ hire ▁ laborers ▁ for ▁ his ▁ vineyard .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ gave ▁ to ▁ moses ▁ when ▁ he ▁ left ▁ off ▁ speaking ▁ to ▁ him ▁ in ▁ mount ▁ sina ▁ the ▁ two ▁ tables ▁ of ▁ testimony, ▁ tables ▁ of ▁ stone ▁ written ▁ upon ▁ with ▁ the ▁ finger ▁ of ▁ god .
▁ then ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ now ▁ will ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ come ▁ down ▁ to ▁ me ▁ to ▁ galgala, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ have ▁ not ▁ sought ▁ the ▁ face ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ so ▁ i ▁ forced ▁ myself ▁ and ▁ offered ▁ the ▁ whole-burnt-offering .
▁ they ▁ that ▁ fear ▁ thee ▁ will ▁ see ▁ me ▁ and ▁ rejoice: ▁ for ▁ i ▁ have ▁ hoped ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ words .
▁ the ▁ second ▁ woe ▁ is ▁ past . ▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ third ▁ woe ▁ comes ▁ quickly .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ answered ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ and ▁ who ▁ is ▁ there ▁ among ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ servants ▁ faithful ▁ as ▁ david, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ is ▁ a ▁ son-in-law ▁ of ▁ the ▁ king, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ is ▁ executor ▁ of ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ commands, ▁ and ▁ is ▁ honourable ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ house?
▁ and ▁ i ▁ sat ▁ down, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ wept ▁ continuously ▁ over ▁ him . ▁ and ▁ as ▁ i ▁ was ▁ weeping ▁ over ▁ him, ▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ christ ▁ opened ▁ the ▁ door ▁ of ▁ the ▁ cell, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ came ▁ in, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ stood ▁ up ▁ by ▁ the ▁ body ▁ of ▁ the ▁ blessed ▁ apa ▁ cyrus, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ wept ▁ over ▁ him ▁ and ▁ i ▁ wept ▁ over ▁ him .
▁ jesus ▁ answered, ▁ 'aren't ▁ there ▁ twelve ▁ hours ▁ of ▁ daylight? ▁ if ▁ a ▁ man ▁ walks ▁ in ▁ the ▁ day, ▁ he ▁ doesn't ▁ stumble, ▁ because ▁ he ▁ sees ▁ the ▁ light ▁ of ▁ this ▁ world .
▁ thy ▁ teeth ▁ are ▁ as ▁ flocks ▁ of ▁ shorn ▁ sheep, ▁ that ▁ have ▁ gone ▁ up ▁ from ▁ the ▁ washing, ▁ all ▁ of ▁ them ▁ bearing ▁ twins, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ is ▁ none ▁ barren ▁ among ▁ them: ▁ thy ▁ lips ▁ are ▁ as ▁ a ▁ thread ▁ of ▁ scarlet, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ speech ▁ is ▁ comely .
▁ and ▁ by ▁ the ▁ good ▁ providence ▁ of ▁ god ▁ neither ▁ he ▁ nor ▁ the ▁ horse ▁ on ▁ which ▁ he ▁ was ▁ riding ▁ became ▁ exhausted ▁ in ▁ that ▁ dense ▁ thicket .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ the ▁ thief ▁ be ▁ found ▁ in ▁ the ▁ breach ▁ made ▁ by ▁ himself ▁ and ▁ be ▁ smitten ▁ and ▁ die, ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ blood ▁ shed ▁ for ▁ him .
▁ that ▁ thy ▁ foot ▁ may ▁ be ▁ dipped ▁ in ▁ blood, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ tongue ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ dogs ▁ be ▁ stained ▁ with ▁ that ▁ of ▁ thine ▁ enemies .
▁...
▁ behold, ▁ as ▁ the ▁ eyes ▁ of ▁ servants ▁ are ▁ directed ▁ to ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ their ▁ masters, ▁ and ▁ as ▁ the ▁ eyes ▁ of ▁ a ▁ maidservant ▁ to ▁ the ▁ hands ▁ of ▁ her ▁ mistress; ▁ so ▁ our ▁ eyes ▁ are ▁ directed ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ our ▁ god, ▁ until ▁ he ▁ have ▁ mercy ▁ upon ▁ us .
▁ they ▁ light ▁ them ▁ candles, ▁ yea, ▁ more ▁ than ▁ for ▁ themselves, ▁ whereof ▁ they ▁ cannot ▁ see ▁ one .
▁ for ▁ of ▁ these ▁ are ▁ those ▁ who ▁ creep ▁ into ▁ houses, ▁ and ▁ take ▁ captive ▁ gullible ▁ women ▁ loaded ▁ down ▁ with ▁ sins, ▁ led ▁ away ▁ by ▁ various ▁ lusts,
▁ judea ▁ has ▁ mourned, ▁ and ▁ her ▁ gates ▁ are ▁ emptied, ▁ and ▁ are ▁ darkened ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ cry ▁ of ▁ jerusalem ▁ is ▁ gone ▁ up .
▁ for ▁ all ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ my ▁ father ▁ were ▁ but ▁ as ▁ dead ▁ men ▁ before ▁ my ▁ lord ▁ the ▁ king; ▁ yet ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ set ▁ thy ▁ servant ▁ among ▁ them ▁ that ▁ eat ▁ at ▁ thy ▁ table: ▁ and ▁ what ▁ right ▁ have ▁ i ▁ any ▁ longer ▁ even ▁ to ▁ cry ▁ to ▁ the ▁ king?
▁ when ▁ i ▁ went ▁ up ▁ into ▁ the ▁ mountain ▁ to ▁ receive ▁ the ▁ tables ▁ of ▁ stone, ▁ the ▁ tables ▁ of ▁ the ▁ covenant, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ made ▁ with ▁ you, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ was ▁ in ▁ the ▁ mountain ▁ forty ▁ days ▁ and ▁ forty ▁ nights, ▁ i ▁ ate ▁ no ▁ bread ▁ and ▁ drank ▁ no ▁ water .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ sins ▁ is ▁ of ▁ the ▁ devil, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ devil ▁ has ▁ been ▁ sinning ▁ from ▁ the ▁ beginning . ▁ to ▁ this ▁ end ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god ▁ was ▁ revealed, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ destroy ▁ the ▁ works ▁ of ▁ the ▁ devil .
▁ but ▁ i ▁ will ▁ exult ▁ for ▁ ever: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ sing ▁ praises ▁ to ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ jacob .
▁ but ▁ if ▁ i ▁ had ▁ gone ▁ with ▁ scorners, ▁ and ▁ if ▁ too ▁ my ▁ foot ▁ has ▁ hasted ▁ to ▁ deceit:
▁ all ▁ testified ▁ about ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ wondered ▁ at ▁ the ▁ gracious ▁ words ▁ which ▁ proceeded ▁ out ▁ of ▁ his ▁ mouth, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ said, ▁ 'isn't ▁ this ▁ joseph's ▁ son?'
▁ he, ▁ leaning ▁ back, ▁ as ▁ he ▁ was, ▁ on ▁ jesus' ▁ breast, ▁ asked ▁ him, ▁ 'lord, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ it?'
▁ we ▁ will ▁ give ▁ thanks ▁ to ▁ thee, ▁ o ▁ god, ▁ we ▁ will ▁ give ▁ thanks, ▁ and ▁ call ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ name: ▁ i ▁ will ▁ declare ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ wonderful ▁ works .
▁ as ▁ he ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ our ▁ fathers, ▁ to ▁ abraham ▁ and ▁ his ▁ seed ▁ forever . '
▁ wherefore ▁ art ▁ thou ▁ very ▁ sad, ▁ o ▁ my ▁ soul? ▁ and ▁ wherefore ▁ dost ▁ thou ▁ trouble ▁ me? ▁ hope ▁ in ▁ god; ▁ for ▁ i ▁ will ▁ give ▁ thanks ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ the ▁ health ▁ of ▁ my ▁ countenance, ▁ and ▁ my ▁ god .
▁ therefore ▁ don't ▁ let ▁ sin ▁ reign ▁ in ▁ your ▁ mortal ▁ body, ▁ that ▁ you ▁ should ▁ obey ▁ it ▁ in ▁ its ▁ lusts .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ nations ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ burnt ▁ up; ▁ as ▁ a ▁ thorn ▁ in ▁ the ▁ field ▁ cast ▁ out ▁ and ▁ burnt ▁ up .
▁ when ▁ moses ▁ saw ▁ it, ▁ he ▁ wondered ▁ at ▁ the ▁ sight . ▁ as ▁ he ▁ came ▁ close ▁ to ▁ see, ▁ a ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ came ▁ to ▁ him,
▁ and ▁ he ▁ embraced ▁ them ▁ with ▁ fervour, ▁ and ▁ he ▁ kissed ▁ them .
▁ for ▁ most ▁ certainly, ▁ he ▁ doesn't ▁ give ▁ help ▁ to ▁ angels, ▁ but ▁ he ▁ gives ▁ help ▁ to ▁ the ▁ seed ▁ of ▁ abraham .
▁ tell ▁ it ▁ not ▁ in ▁ geth, ▁ and ▁ tell ▁ it ▁ not ▁ as ▁ glad ▁ tidings ▁ in ▁ the ▁ streets ▁ of ▁ ascalon, ▁ lest ▁ the ▁ daughters ▁ of ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ rejoice, ▁ lest ▁ the ▁ daughters ▁ of ▁ the ▁ uncircumcised ▁ triumph .
▁ hear ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ ye ▁ nations, ▁ and ▁ proclaim ▁ them ▁ to ▁ the ▁ islands ▁ afar ▁ off; ▁ say, ▁ he ▁ that ▁ scattered ▁ israel ▁ will ▁ also ▁ gather ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ keep ▁ him ▁ as ▁ one ▁ that ▁ feeds ▁ his ▁ flock .
▁ for ▁ i ▁ am ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god, ▁ that ▁ brought ▁ thee ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt: ▁ open ▁ thy ▁ mouth ▁ wide, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ fill ▁ it .
▁ jesus ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'have ▁ i ▁ been ▁ with ▁ you ▁ such ▁ a ▁ long ▁ time, ▁ and ▁ do ▁ you ▁ not ▁ know ▁ me, ▁ philip? ▁ he ▁ who ▁ has ▁ seen ▁ me ▁ has ▁ seen ▁ the ▁ father . ▁ how ▁ do ▁ you ▁ say, ▁ 'show ▁ us ▁ the ▁ father?'
▁ after ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ jesus ▁ was ▁ walking ▁ in ▁ galilee, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ wouldn't ▁ walk ▁ in ▁ judea, ▁ because ▁ the ▁ jews ▁ sought ▁ to ▁ kill ▁ him .
▁ and ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ a ▁ great ▁ cry ▁ through ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egypt, ▁ such ▁ as ▁ has ▁ not ▁ been, ▁ and ▁ such ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ be ▁ repeated ▁ any ▁ more .
▁ running ▁ under ▁ the ▁ lee ▁ of ▁ a ▁ small ▁ island ▁ called ▁ clauda, ▁ we ▁ were ▁ able, ▁ with ▁ difficulty, ▁ to ▁ secure ▁ the ▁ boat .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ knelt ▁ down ▁ together ▁ on ▁ their ▁ knees,
▁ with ▁ all ▁ prayer ▁ and ▁ requests, ▁ praying ▁ at ▁ all ▁ times ▁ in ▁ the ▁ spirit, ▁ and ▁ being ▁ watchful ▁ to ▁ this ▁ end ▁ in ▁ all ▁ perseverance ▁ and ▁ requests ▁ for ▁ all ▁ the ▁ saints:
▁ but ▁ godliness ▁ with ▁ contentment ▁ is ▁ great ▁ gain .
▁ and ▁ moses ▁ built ▁ an ▁ altar ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ called ▁ the ▁ name ▁ of ▁ it, ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ my ▁ refuge .
▁ and ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ shouldest ▁ come ▁ upon ▁ a ▁ brood ▁ of ▁ birds ▁ before ▁ thy ▁ face ▁ in ▁ the ▁ way ▁ or ▁ upon ▁ any ▁ tree, ▁ or ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ young ▁ or ▁ eggs, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ mother ▁ be ▁ brooding ▁ on ▁ the ▁ young ▁ or ▁ the ▁ eggs, ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ take ▁ the ▁ dam ▁ with ▁ the ▁ young ▁ ones .
▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ turn ▁ back ▁ the ▁ shadow ▁ of ▁ the ▁ degrees ▁ of ▁ the ▁ dial ▁ by ▁ which ▁ ten ▁ degrees ▁ on ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ father ▁ the ▁ sun ▁ has ▁ gone ▁ downi ▁ will ▁ turn ▁ back ▁ the ▁ sun ▁ the ▁ ten ▁ degrees; ▁ so ▁ the ▁ sun ▁ went ▁ back ▁ the ▁ ten ▁ degrees ▁ by ▁ which ▁ the ▁ shadow ▁ had ▁ gone ▁ down .
▁ how ▁ much ▁ more ▁ shall ▁ he ▁ give ▁ us ▁ wages ▁ for ▁ our ▁ good ▁ works, ▁ even ▁ though ▁ they ▁ be ▁ very ▁ few?
▁ 'to ▁ the ▁ angel ▁ of ▁ the ▁ assembly ▁ in ▁ smyrna ▁ write: ▁ 'the ▁ first ▁ and ▁ the ▁ last, ▁ who ▁ was ▁ dead, ▁ and ▁ has ▁ come ▁ to ▁ life ▁ says ▁ these ▁ things:
▁ they ▁ will ▁ perish, ▁ but ▁ you ▁ continue . ▁ they ▁ all ▁ will ▁ grow ▁ old ▁ like ▁ a ▁ garment ▁ does .
▁ he ▁ took ▁ it ▁ down, ▁ and ▁ wrapped ▁ it ▁ in ▁ a ▁ linen ▁ cloth, ▁ and ▁ laid ▁ him ▁ in ▁ a ▁ tomb ▁ that ▁ was ▁ cut ▁ in ▁ stone, ▁ where ▁ no ▁ one ▁ had ▁ ever ▁ been ▁ laid .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ cause ▁ all ▁ thy ▁ sons ▁ to ▁ be ▁ taught ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ children ▁ to ▁ be ▁ in ▁ great ▁ peace .
▁ they ▁ listened ▁ to ▁ him ▁ until ▁ he ▁ said ▁ that; ▁ then ▁ they ▁ lifted ▁ up ▁ their ▁ voice, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'rid ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ of ▁ this ▁ fellow, ▁ for ▁ he ▁ isn't ▁ fit ▁ to ▁ live!'
▁ i ▁ know ▁ that ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ good ▁ in ▁ them, ▁ except ▁ for ▁ a ▁ man ▁ to ▁ rejoice, ▁ and ▁ to ▁ do ▁ good ▁ in ▁ his ▁ life .
▁ this ▁ is ▁ the ▁ message ▁ which ▁ we ▁ have ▁ heard ▁ from ▁ him ▁ and ▁ announce ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ that ▁ god ▁ is ▁ light, ▁ and ▁ in ▁ him ▁ is ▁ no ▁ darkness ▁ at ▁ all .
▁ now ▁ simon ▁ peter ▁ was ▁ standing ▁ and ▁ warming ▁ himself . ▁ they ▁ said ▁ therefore ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'you ▁ aren't ▁ also ▁ one ▁ of ▁ his ▁ disciples, ▁ are ▁ you?' ▁ he ▁ denied ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ said, ▁ 'i ▁ am ▁ not . '
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ brought ▁ us ▁ out ▁ of ▁ egypt ▁ himself ▁ with ▁ his ▁ great ▁ strength, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ mighty ▁ hand, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ high ▁ arm, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ great ▁ visions, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ signs, ▁ and ▁ with ▁ wonders .
▁ brothers, ▁ if ▁ any ▁ among ▁ you ▁ wanders ▁ from ▁ the ▁ truth, ▁ and ▁ someone ▁ turns ▁ him ▁ back,
▁ woe ▁ be ▁ unto ▁ every ▁ one ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ hearken ▁ unto ▁ him, ▁ for ▁ their ▁ habitation ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ the ▁ pit ▁ of ▁ the ▁ abyss ▁ for ▁ ever, ▁ and ▁ their ▁ father ▁ is ▁ the ▁ devil .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ inform ▁ thee, ▁ saying, ▁ buy ▁ it ▁ before ▁ those ▁ that ▁ sit, ▁ and ▁ before ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ of ▁ my ▁ people: ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ wilt ▁ redeem ▁ it, ▁ redeem ▁ it, ▁ but ▁ if ▁ thou ▁ wilt ▁ not ▁ redeem ▁ it, ▁ tell ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ shall ▁ know; ▁ for ▁ there ▁ is ▁ no ▁ one ▁ beside ▁ thee ▁ to ▁ do ▁ the ▁ office ▁ of ▁ a ▁ kinsman, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ am ▁ after ▁ thee: ▁ and ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ i ▁ am ▁ here, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ redeem ▁ it .
▁ let ▁ thine ▁ eyes ▁ look ▁ right ▁ on, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ thine ▁ eyelids ▁ assent ▁ to ▁ just ▁ things .
▁ he ▁ that ▁ reverences ▁ not ▁ the ▁ persons ▁ of ▁ the ▁ just ▁ is ▁ not ▁ good: ▁ such ▁ a ▁ one ▁ will ▁ sell ▁ a ▁ man ▁ for ▁ a ▁ morsel ▁ of ▁ bread .
▁ without ▁ father, ▁ without ▁ mother, ▁ without ▁ genealogy, ▁ having ▁ neither ▁ beginning ▁ of ▁ days ▁ nor ▁ end ▁ of ▁ life, ▁ but ▁ made ▁ like ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god), ▁ remains ▁ a ▁ priest ▁ continually .
▁ the ▁ man ▁ who ▁ hath ▁ gotten ▁ himself ▁ humility ▁ judgeth ▁ himself, ▁ saying,
▁ now ▁ faith ▁ is ▁ assurance ▁ of ▁ things ▁ hoped ▁ for, ▁ proof ▁ of ▁ things ▁ not ▁ seen .
▁ i ▁ will ▁ bring ▁ them ▁ to ▁ my ▁ holy ▁ mountain, ▁ and ▁ gladden ▁ them ▁ in ▁ my ▁ house ▁ of ▁ prayer: ▁ their ▁ whole-burnt-offerings ▁ and ▁ their ▁ sacrifices ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ acceptable ▁ upon ▁ mine ▁ altar; ▁ for ▁ my ▁ house ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ called ▁ a ▁ house ▁ of ▁ prayer ▁ for ▁ all ▁ nations,
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ him, ▁ ' ▁ my ▁ father, ▁ i ▁ know ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ must ▁ be ▁ cold ▁ in ▁ winter, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ wilt ▁ not ▁ be ▁ burnt ▁ up ▁ with ▁ the ▁ heat ▁ in ▁ the ▁ summer, ▁ when ▁ wearing ▁ a ▁ tunic ▁ of ▁ this ▁ kind . '
▁ but ▁ speaking ▁ truth ▁ in ▁ love, ▁ we ▁ may ▁ grow ▁ up ▁ in ▁ all ▁ things ▁ into ▁ him, ▁ who ▁ is ▁ the ▁ head, ▁ christ;
▁ and ▁ they ▁ departed ▁ with ▁ much ▁ wealth ▁ to ▁ their ▁ houses, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ divided ▁ the ▁ spoil ▁ of ▁ their ▁ enemies ▁ with ▁ their ▁ brethren; ▁ very ▁ much ▁ cattle, ▁ and ▁ silver, ▁ and ▁ gold, ▁ and ▁ iron, ▁ and ▁ much ▁ raiment .
▁ he ▁ will ▁ come ▁ and ▁ destroy ▁ these ▁ farmers, ▁ and ▁ will ▁ give ▁ the ▁ vineyard ▁ to ▁ others . ' ▁ when ▁ they ▁ heard ▁ it, ▁ they ▁ said, ▁ 'may ▁ it ▁ never ▁ be!'
▁ and ▁ i ▁ heard ▁ them ▁ speaking ▁ about ▁ our ▁ father ▁ elijah, ▁ the ▁ tishbite, ▁ and ▁ saying ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ wholly ▁ powerful ▁ in ▁ god ▁ while ▁ he ▁ lived ▁ in ▁ this ▁ desert ▁.
▁ and ▁ they ▁ said, ▁ 'since ▁ he ▁ saith ▁ ''take ▁ me ▁ to ▁ apa ▁ pisentius, ▁ the ▁ bishop', ▁ if ▁ he ▁ is ▁ to ▁ live, ▁ let ▁ us ▁ persuade ▁ ourselves ▁ to ▁ do ▁ as ▁ he ▁ saith .
▁ this ▁ commandment ▁ we ▁ have ▁ from ▁ him, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ who ▁ loves ▁ god ▁ should ▁ also ▁ love ▁ his ▁ brother .
▁ yea, ▁ the ▁ stork ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heaven ▁ knows ▁ her ▁ time, ▁ also ▁ the ▁ turtle-dove ▁ and ▁ wild ▁ swallow; ▁ the ▁ sparrows ▁ observe ▁ the ▁ times ▁ of ▁ their ▁ coming ▁ in; ▁ but ▁ this ▁ my ▁ people ▁ knows ▁ not ▁ the ▁ judgments ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ then ▁ david ▁ rose ▁ up ▁ from ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ washed, ▁ and ▁ anointed ▁ himself, ▁ and ▁ changed ▁ his ▁ raiment, ▁ and ▁ went ▁ into ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ worshipped ▁ him; ▁ and ▁ went ▁ into ▁ his ▁ own ▁ house, ▁ and ▁ called ▁ for ▁ bread ▁ to ▁ eat, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ set ▁ bread ▁ before ▁ him ▁ and ▁ he ▁ ate .
▁ to ▁ demonstrate ▁ his ▁ righteousness ▁ at ▁ this ▁ present ▁ time; ▁ that ▁ he ▁ might ▁ himself ▁ be ▁ just, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ justifier ▁ of ▁ him ▁ who ▁ has ▁ faith ▁ in ▁ jesus .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ commandment ▁ of ▁ the ▁ law ▁ is ▁ a ▁ lamp ▁ and ▁ a ▁ light; ▁ a ▁ way ▁ of ▁ life; ▁ reproof ▁ also ▁ and ▁ correction:
▁ blessed ▁ be ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ for ▁ he ▁ has ▁ magnified ▁ his ▁ mercy ▁ in ▁ a ▁ fortified ▁ city .
▁ to ▁ them ▁ it ▁ was ▁ revealed, ▁ that ▁ not ▁ to ▁ themselves, ▁ but ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ they ▁ ministered ▁ these ▁ things, ▁ which ▁ now ▁ have ▁ been ▁ announced ▁ to ▁ you ▁ through ▁ those ▁ who ▁ preached ▁ the ▁ good ▁ news ▁ to ▁ you ▁ by ▁ the ▁ holy ▁ spirit ▁ sent ▁ out ▁ from ▁ heaven; ▁ which ▁ things ▁ angels ▁ desire ▁ to ▁ look ▁ into .
▁ now ▁ to ▁ him ▁ who ▁ works, ▁ the ▁ reward ▁ is ▁ not ▁ counted ▁ as ▁ grace, ▁ but ▁ as ▁ debt .

▁ behold, ▁ the ▁ inheritance ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ children, ▁ the ▁ reward ▁ of ▁ the ▁ fruit ▁ of ▁ the ▁ womb .
▁ the ▁ day ▁ following, ▁ paul ▁ went ▁ in ▁ with ▁ us ▁ to ▁ james; ▁ and ▁ all ▁ the ▁ elders ▁ were ▁ present .
▁ for ▁ we ▁ were ▁ saved ▁ in ▁ hope, ▁ but ▁ hope ▁ that ▁ is ▁ seen ▁ is ▁ not ▁ hope . ▁ for ▁ who ▁ hopes ▁ for ▁ that ▁ which ▁ he ▁ sees?
▁ while ▁ my ▁ bones ▁ were ▁ breaking, ▁ they ▁ that ▁ afflicted ▁ me ▁ reproached ▁ me; ▁ while ▁ they ▁ said ▁ to ▁ me ▁ daily, ▁ where ▁ is ▁ thy ▁ god?
▁ the ▁ devil ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'if ▁ you ▁ are ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ god, ▁ command ▁ this ▁ stone ▁ to ▁ become ▁ bread . '
▁ for ▁ like ▁ as ▁ a ▁ vessel ▁ that ▁ a ▁ man ▁ useth ▁ is ▁ nothing ▁ worth ▁ when ▁ it ▁ is ▁ broken; ▁ even ▁ so ▁ it ▁ is ▁ with ▁ their ▁ gods: ▁ when ▁ they ▁ be ▁ set ▁ up ▁ in ▁ the ▁ temple, ▁ their ▁ eyes ▁ be ▁ full ▁ of ▁ dust ▁ through ▁ the ▁ feet ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ come ▁ in .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ proceeded ▁ to ▁ take ▁ possession ▁ of ▁ the ▁ land ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ borders, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel ▁ gave ▁ an ▁ inheritance ▁ to ▁ joshua ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ naue ▁ among ▁ them,
▁ he ▁ created ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ saw ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ numbered ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ poured ▁ her ▁ out ▁ upon ▁ all ▁ his ▁ works .
▁ and ▁ gaal ▁ went ▁ forth ▁ before ▁ the ▁ men ▁ of ▁ sychem, ▁ and ▁ set ▁ the ▁ battle ▁ in ▁ array ▁ against ▁ abimelech .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ invisible ▁ things ▁ of ▁ him ▁ since ▁ the ▁ creation ▁ of ▁ the ▁ world ▁ are ▁ clearly ▁ seen, ▁ being ▁ perceived ▁ through ▁ the ▁ things ▁ that ▁ are ▁ made, ▁ even ▁ his ▁ everlasting ▁ power ▁ and ▁ divinity; ▁ that ▁ they ▁ may ▁ be ▁ without ▁ excuse .
▁ for ▁ there ▁ is ▁ a ▁ cup ▁ in ▁ the ▁ hand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ full ▁ of ▁ unmingled ▁ wine; ▁ and ▁ he ▁ has ▁ turned ▁ it ▁ from ▁ side ▁ to ▁ side, ▁ but ▁ its ▁ dregs ▁ have ▁ not ▁ been ▁ wholly ▁ poured ▁ out; ▁ all ▁ the ▁ sinners ▁ of ▁ the ▁ earth ▁ shall ▁ drink ▁ them .
▁ lo! ▁ did ▁ not ▁ achar ▁ the ▁ son ▁ of ▁ zara ▁ commit ▁ a ▁ trespass ▁ taking ▁ of ▁ the ▁ accursed ▁ thing, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ was ▁ wrath ▁ on ▁ the ▁ whole ▁ congregation ▁ of ▁ israel? ▁ and ▁ he ▁ himself ▁ died ▁ alone ▁ in ▁ his ▁ own ▁ sin .
▁ let ▁ servants ▁ be ▁ husbands ▁ of ▁ one ▁ wife, ▁ ruling ▁ their ▁ children ▁ and ▁ their ▁ own ▁ houses ▁ well .
▁ neither ▁ spared ▁ he ▁ the ▁ place ▁ where ▁ lot ▁ sojourned, ▁ but ▁ abhorred ▁ them ▁ for ▁ their ▁ pride .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ moses ▁ after ▁ the ▁ two ▁ sons ▁ of ▁ aaron ▁ died ▁ in ▁ bringing ▁ strange ▁ fire ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ so ▁ they ▁ died .
▁ it ▁ will ▁ not ▁ permit ▁ a ▁ man ▁ to ▁ know ▁ the ▁ mystery ▁ of ▁ god,
▁...
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ when ▁ chusi ▁ the ▁ chief ▁ friend ▁ of ▁ david ▁ came ▁ to ▁ abessalom, ▁ that ▁ chusi ▁ said ▁ to ▁ abessalom, ▁ let ▁ the ▁ king ▁ live .
▁ for ▁ the ▁ angels ▁ love ▁ those ▁ who ▁ love ▁ their ▁ own ▁ god .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ blessed ▁ the ▁ latter ▁ end ▁ of ▁ job, ▁ more ▁ than ▁ the ▁ beginning: ▁ and ▁ his ▁ cattle ▁ were ▁ fourteen ▁ thousand ▁ sheep, ▁ six ▁ thousand ▁ camels, ▁ a ▁ thousand ▁ yoke ▁ of ▁ oxen, ▁ a ▁ thousand ▁ she-asses ▁ of ▁ the ▁ pastures .
▁ for ▁ this ▁ cause ▁ i, ▁ paul, ▁ am ▁ the ▁ prisoner ▁ of ▁ christ ▁ jesus ▁ on ▁ behalf ▁ of ▁ you ▁ gentiles,
▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ burn ▁ with ▁ fire ▁ the ▁ graven ▁ images ▁ of ▁ their ▁ gods: ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ not ▁ covet ▁ their ▁ silver, ▁ neither ▁ shalt ▁ thou ▁ take ▁ to ▁ thyself ▁ gold ▁ from ▁ them, ▁ lest ▁ thou ▁ shouldest ▁ offend ▁ thereby, ▁ because ▁ it ▁ is ▁ an ▁ abomination ▁ to ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god .
▁ solomon ▁ had ▁ a ▁ vineyard ▁ in ▁ beelamon; ▁ he ▁ let ▁ his ▁ vineyard ▁ to ▁ keepers; ▁ every ▁ one ▁ was ▁ to ▁ bring ▁ for ▁ its ▁ fruit ▁ a ▁ thousand ▁ pieces ▁ of ▁ silver .
▁ and ▁ when ▁ the ▁ people ▁ saw ▁ that ▁ moses ▁ delayed ▁ to ▁ come ▁ down ▁ from ▁ the ▁ mountain, ▁ the ▁ people ▁ combined ▁ against ▁ aaron, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ arise ▁ and ▁ make ▁ us ▁ gods ▁ who ▁ shall ▁ go ▁ before ▁ us; ▁ for ▁ this ▁ moses, ▁ the ▁ man ▁ who ▁ brought ▁ us ▁ forth ▁ out ▁ of ▁ the ▁ land ▁ of ▁ egyptwe ▁ do ▁ not ▁ know ▁ what ▁ is ▁ become ▁ of ▁ him .
▁ o ▁ how ▁ great ▁ is ▁ he ▁ that ▁ findeth ▁ wisdom! ▁ yet ▁ is ▁ there ▁ none ▁ above ▁ him ▁ that ▁ feareth ▁ the ▁ lord .
▁ for ▁ we ▁ are ▁ going ▁ to ▁ destroy ▁ this ▁ place; ▁ for ▁ their ▁ cry ▁ has ▁ been ▁ raised ▁ up ▁ before ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ sent ▁ us ▁ to ▁ destroy ▁ it .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ the ▁ cherubim, ▁ 'my ▁ lord, ▁ shew ▁ me ▁ the ▁ matter ▁ of ▁ the ▁ angel ▁ of ▁ wrath ▁ whose ▁ eyes ▁ drop ▁ blood ▁ into ▁ the ▁ fountain'
▁ the ▁ sinner ▁ has ▁ provoked ▁ the ▁ lord: ▁ according ▁ to ▁ the ▁ abundance ▁ of ▁ his ▁ pride ▁ he ▁ will ▁ not ▁ seek ▁ after ▁ him: ▁ god ▁ is ▁ not ▁ before ▁ him .
▁ let ▁ us ▁ flee ▁ from ▁ that ▁ shame ▁ which ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ for ▁ ever,
▁ paul ▁ said, ▁ 'i ▁ didn't ▁ know, ▁ brothers, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ was ▁ high ▁ priest . ▁ for ▁ it ▁ is ▁ written, ▁ 'you ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ speak ▁ evil ▁ of ▁ a ▁ ruler ▁ of ▁ your ▁ people . ''
▁ as ▁ a ▁ mantle, ▁ you ▁ will ▁ roll ▁ them ▁ up, ▁ and ▁ they ▁ will ▁ be ▁ changed; ▁ but ▁ you ▁ are ▁ the ▁ same . ▁ your ▁ years ▁ will ▁ not ▁ fail . '
▁ and ▁ the ▁ cities ▁ of ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ benjamin ▁ according ▁ to ▁ their ▁ families ▁ were ▁ jericho, ▁ and ▁ bethagaeo, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ amecasis,
▁ to ▁ the ▁ praise ▁ of ▁ the ▁ glory ▁ of ▁ his ▁ grace, ▁ by ▁ which ▁ he ▁ freely ▁ bestowed ▁ favor ▁ on ▁ us ▁ in ▁ the ▁ beloved,
▁ but ▁ i, ▁ as ▁ a ▁ deaf ▁ man, ▁ heard ▁ not; ▁ and ▁ was ▁ as ▁ a ▁ dumb ▁ man ▁ not ▁ opening ▁ his ▁ mouth .
▁ but ▁ they ▁ hearkened ▁ not ▁ to ▁ me, ▁ and ▁ inclined ▁ not ▁ their ▁ ear ▁ to ▁ turn ▁ from ▁ their ▁ wickedness, ▁ so ▁ as ▁ not ▁ to ▁ burn ▁ incense ▁ to ▁ strange ▁ gods .
▁ the ▁ root ▁ of ▁ wisdom ▁ is ▁ to ▁ fear ▁ the ▁ lord, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ branches ▁ thereof ▁ are ▁ long ▁ life .
▁ because ▁ we ▁ are ▁ members ▁ of ▁ his ▁ body, ▁ of ▁ his ▁ flesh ▁ and ▁ bones .
▁ i ▁ have ▁ been ▁ forgotten ▁ as ▁ a ▁ dead ▁ man ▁ out ▁ of ▁ mind: ▁ i ▁ am ▁ become ▁ as ▁ a ▁ broken ▁ vessel .
▁ and ▁ ye ▁ shall ▁ know ▁ them ▁ to ▁ be ▁ no ▁ gods ▁ by ▁ the ▁ bright ▁ purple ▁ that ▁ rotteth ▁ upon ▁ them: ▁ and ▁ they ▁ themselves ▁ afterward ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ eaten, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ a ▁ reproach ▁ in ▁ the ▁ country .
▁ who ▁ can ▁ number ▁ the ▁ sand ▁ of ▁ the ▁ sea, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ drops ▁ of ▁ rain, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ eternity?
▁ and ▁ again ▁ i ▁ said ▁ unto ▁ the ▁ cherubim,
▁ whose ▁ gold, ▁ and ▁ silver, ▁ and ▁ garments ▁ wherewith ▁ they ▁ are ▁ clothed, ▁ they ▁ that ▁ are ▁ strong ▁ take, ▁ and ▁ go ▁ away ▁ withal: ▁ neither ▁ are ▁ they ▁ able ▁ to ▁ help ▁ themselves .
▁ for ▁ as ▁ many ▁ as ▁ have ▁ sinned ▁ without ▁ law ▁ will ▁ also ▁ perish ▁ without ▁ the ▁ law . ▁ as ▁ many ▁ as ▁ have ▁ sinned ▁ under ▁ the ▁ law ▁ will ▁ be ▁ judged ▁ by ▁ the ▁ law .
▁ where ▁ is ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ emath, ▁ and ▁ arphath? ▁ and ▁ where ▁ is ▁ the ▁ god ▁ of ▁ eppharuaim? ▁ have ▁ they ▁ been ▁ able ▁ to ▁ deliver ▁ samaria ▁ out ▁ of ▁ my ▁ hand?
▁ better ▁ is ▁ a ▁ meek-spirited ▁ man ▁ with ▁ lowliness, ▁ than ▁ one ▁ who ▁ divides ▁ spoils ▁ with ▁ the ▁ proud .
▁ hear ▁ me, ▁ ye ▁ that ▁ know ▁ judgment, ▁ the ▁ people ▁ in ▁ whose ▁ heart ▁ is ▁ my ▁ law: ▁ fear ▁ not ▁ the ▁ reproach ▁ of ▁ men, ▁ and ▁ be ▁ not ▁ overcome ▁ by ▁ their ▁ contempt .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ after ▁ forty ▁ days ▁ noe ▁ opened ▁ the ▁ window ▁ of ▁ the ▁ ark ▁ which ▁ he ▁ had ▁ made .
▁ i ▁ am ▁ thine, ▁ save ▁ me; ▁ for ▁ i ▁ have ▁ sought ▁ out ▁ thine ▁ ordinances .
▁ and ▁ we ▁ ate ▁ them ▁ together,
▁ and ▁ i ▁ spoke ▁ to ▁ you, ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ did ▁ not ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ me; ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ transgressed ▁ the ▁ commandment ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord; ▁ and ▁ ye ▁ forced ▁ your ▁ way ▁ and ▁ went ▁ up ▁ into ▁ the ▁ mountain .
▁ and ▁ the ▁ water ▁ prevailed ▁ exceedingly ▁ upon ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ and ▁ covered ▁ all ▁ the ▁ high ▁ mountains ▁ which ▁ were ▁ under ▁ heaven .
▁ jesus ▁ answered, ▁ 'i ▁ don't ▁ have ▁ a ▁ demon, ▁ but ▁ i ▁ honor ▁ my ▁ father, ▁ and ▁ you ▁ dishonor ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ brought ▁ out ▁ his ▁ people ▁ with ▁ exultation, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ chosen ▁ with ▁ joy;
▁ i ▁ have ▁ no ▁ feeling ▁ of ▁ envy ▁ (or, ▁ jealousy) ▁ in ▁ me .
▁ and ▁ it ▁ came ▁ to ▁ pass ▁ at ▁ the ▁ seventh ▁ circuit ▁ the ▁ priests ▁ blew ▁ the ▁ trumpets; ▁ and ▁ joshua ▁ said ▁ to ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ shout, ▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ has ▁ given ▁ you ▁ the ▁ city .
▁ and ▁ now, ▁ behold, ▁ i ▁ have ▁ heard ▁ that ▁ thy ▁ shepherds ▁ who ▁ were ▁ with ▁ is ▁ in ▁ the ▁ wilderness ▁ are ▁ shearing ▁ thy ▁ sheep, ▁ and ▁ we ▁ hindered ▁ them ▁ not, ▁ neither ▁ did ▁ we ▁ demand ▁ any ▁ thing ▁ from ▁ them ▁ all ▁ the ▁ time ▁ they ▁ were ▁ in ▁ carmel .
▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ return ▁ and ▁ hearken ▁ to ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ thy ▁ god, ▁ and ▁ shall ▁ keep ▁ his ▁ commands, ▁ all ▁ that ▁ i ▁ charge ▁ thee ▁ this ▁ day .
▁ therefore ▁ come ▁ this ▁ very ▁ night, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ us ▁ go ▁ and ▁ receive ▁ baptism ▁ from ▁ the ▁ high ▁ priest ▁ of ▁ the ▁ christians, ▁ even ▁ as ▁ thou ▁ wast ▁ commanded,
▁ and ▁ hinds ▁ calved ▁ in ▁ the ▁ field, ▁ and ▁ forsook ▁ it, ▁ because ▁ there ▁ was ▁ no ▁ grass .
▁ and ▁ now, ▁ o ▁ lord ▁ my ▁ lord, ▁ thou ▁ art ▁ god; ▁ and ▁ thy ▁ words ▁ will ▁ be ▁ true, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ spoken ▁ these ▁ good ▁ things ▁ concerning ▁ thy ▁ servant .
▁ esrom ▁ begot ▁ aram; ▁ and ▁ aram ▁ begot ▁ aminadab .
▁ and ▁ to ▁ adam ▁ he ▁ said, ▁ because ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ hearkened ▁ to ▁ the ▁ voice ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ wife, ▁ and ▁ eaten ▁ of ▁ the ▁ tree ▁ concerning ▁ which ▁ i ▁ charged ▁ thee ▁ of ▁ it ▁ only ▁ not ▁ to ▁ eatof ▁ that ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ eaten, ▁ cursed ▁ the ▁ ground ▁ in ▁ thy ▁ labours, ▁ in ▁ pain ▁ shalt ▁ thou ▁ eat ▁ of ▁ it ▁ all ▁ the ▁ days ▁ of ▁ thy ▁ life .
▁ woe ▁ to ▁ you ▁ pharisees! ▁ for ▁ you ▁ love ▁ the ▁ best ▁ seats ▁ in ▁ the ▁ synagogues, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ greetings ▁ in ▁ the ▁ marketplaces .
▁ for ▁ this ▁ is ▁ he, ▁ of ▁ whom ▁ it ▁ is ▁ written, ▁ 'behold, ▁ i ▁ send ▁ my ▁ messenger ▁ before ▁ your ▁ face, ▁ who ▁ will ▁ prepare ▁ your ▁ way ▁ before ▁ you . '
▁ to ▁ the ▁ intent ▁ that ▁ now ▁ through ▁ the ▁ assembly ▁ the ▁ manifold ▁ wisdom ▁ of ▁ god ▁ might ▁ be ▁ made ▁ known ▁ to ▁ the ▁ principalities ▁ and ▁ the ▁ powers ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heavenly ▁ places,
▁ save ▁ me, ▁ o ▁ lord; ▁ for ▁ the ▁ godly ▁ man ▁ has ▁ failed; ▁ for ▁ truth ▁ is ▁ diminished ▁ from ▁ among ▁ the ▁ children ▁ of ▁ men .
▁ and ▁ i ▁ prayed, ▁ and ▁ behold ▁ the ▁ man ▁ who ▁ had ▁ come ▁ unto ▁ me ▁ at ▁ first ▁ again ▁ came ▁ unto ▁ me,
▁ and ▁ david ▁ said, ▁ lord ▁ god ▁ of ▁ israel, ▁ thy ▁ servant ▁ has ▁ indeed ▁ heard, ▁ that ▁ saul ▁ seeks ▁ to ▁ come ▁ against ▁ keila ▁ to ▁ destroy ▁ the ▁ city ▁ on ▁ my ▁ account .
▁ but ▁ love ▁ your ▁ enemies, ▁ and ▁ do ▁ good, ▁ and ▁ lend, ▁ expecting ▁ nothing ▁ back; ▁ and ▁ your ▁ reward ▁ will ▁ be ▁ great, ▁ and ▁ you ▁ will ▁ be ▁ children ▁ of ▁ the ▁ most ▁ high; ▁ for ▁ he ▁ is ▁ kind ▁ toward ▁ the ▁ unthankful ▁ and ▁ evil .
▁ if ▁ it ▁ is ▁ so ▁ that ▁ you ▁ have ▁ heard ▁ of ▁ the ▁ administration ▁ of ▁ that ▁ grace ▁ of ▁ god ▁ which ▁ was ▁ given ▁ me ▁ toward ▁ you;
▁ neither ▁ can ▁ they ▁ shew ▁ signs ▁ in ▁ the ▁ heavens ▁ among ▁ the ▁ heathen, ▁ nor ▁ shine ▁ as ▁ the ▁ sun, ▁ nor ▁ give ▁ light ▁ as ▁ the ▁ moon .
▁ forgive ▁ us ▁ our ▁ sins, ▁ for ▁ we ▁ ourselves ▁ also ▁ forgive ▁ everyone ▁ who ▁ is ▁ indebted ▁ to ▁ us . ▁ bring ▁ us ▁ not ▁ into ▁ temptation, ▁ but ▁ deliver ▁ us ▁ from ▁ the ▁ evil ▁ one . ''
▁ pilate ▁ therefore ▁ said ▁ to ▁ him, ▁ 'aren't ▁ you ▁ speaking ▁ to ▁ me? ▁ don't ▁ you ▁ know ▁ that ▁ i ▁ have ▁ power ▁ to ▁ release ▁ you, ▁ and ▁ have ▁ power ▁ to ▁ crucify ▁ you?'
▁ go ▁ not ▁ after ▁ thy ▁ lusts, ▁ but ▁ refrain ▁ thyself ▁ from ▁ thine ▁ appetites .
▁ they ▁ shall ▁ not ▁ wrest ▁ judgment, ▁ nor ▁ favour ▁ persons, ▁ nor ▁ receive ▁ a ▁ gift; ▁ for ▁ gifts ▁ blind ▁ the ▁ eyes ▁ of ▁ the ▁ wise, ▁ and ▁ pervert ▁ the ▁ words ▁ of ▁ the ▁ righteous .
▁ my ▁ strength ▁ is ▁ dried ▁ up, ▁ like ▁ a ▁ potsherd; ▁ and ▁ my ▁ tongue ▁ is ▁ glued ▁ to ▁ my ▁ throat; ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ brought ▁ me ▁ down ▁ to ▁ the ▁ dust ▁ of ▁ death .
▁ for ▁ there ▁ are ▁ set ▁ thrones ▁ for ▁ judgment, ▁ even ▁ thrones ▁ for ▁ the ▁ house ▁ of ▁ david .
▁ now, ▁ therefore, ▁ hearken ▁ thou ▁ unto ▁ me, ▁ my ▁ mother, ▁ and ▁ i ▁ will ▁ declare ▁ in ▁ thine ▁ ears ▁ my ▁ words ▁ which ▁ are ▁ sweet .
▁ a ▁ full ▁ soul ▁ scorns ▁ honeycombs; ▁ but ▁ to ▁ a ▁ hungry ▁ soul ▁ even ▁ bitter ▁ things ▁ appear ▁ sweet .
▁ greet ▁ one ▁ another ▁ with ▁ a ▁ holy ▁ kiss . ▁ the ▁ assemblies ▁ of ▁ christ ▁ greet ▁ you .
▁ he ▁ who ▁ was ▁ dead ▁ came ▁ out, ▁ bound ▁ hand ▁ and ▁ foot ▁ with ▁ wrappings, ▁ and ▁ his ▁ face ▁ was ▁ wrapped ▁ around ▁ with ▁ a ▁ cloth . ▁ jesus ▁ said ▁ to ▁ them, ▁ 'free ▁ him, ▁ and ▁ let ▁ him ▁ go . '
▁ the ▁ chief ▁ thing ▁ for ▁ life ▁ is ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ bread, ▁ and ▁ clothing, ▁ and ▁ an ▁ house ▁ to ▁ cover ▁ shame .

▁ what ▁ then ▁ shall ▁ i ▁ do ▁ if ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ should ▁ try ▁ me? ▁ and ▁ if ▁ also ▁ he ▁ should ▁ at ▁ all ▁ visit ▁ me, ▁ can ▁ i ▁ make ▁ an ▁ answer?
▁ for ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ will ▁ plead ▁ his ▁ cause, ▁ and ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ deliver ▁ thy ▁ soul ▁ in ▁ safety .
▁ for ▁ what ▁ this ▁ woman ▁ had ▁ entreated ▁ god ▁ to ▁ grant ▁ her ▁ was ▁ that ▁ a ▁ pagan ▁ man ▁ should ▁ not ▁ touch ▁ her ▁ at ▁ all .
▁ and ▁ he ▁ shall ▁ establish ▁ to ▁ thee ▁ again ▁ a ▁ habitation ▁ of ▁ righteousness ▁ and ▁ there ▁ shall ▁ be ▁ light ▁ upon ▁ thy ▁ paths .
▁ and ▁ they ▁ came ▁ to ▁ aelim, ▁ and ▁ there ▁ were ▁ there ▁ twelve ▁ fountains ▁ of ▁ water, ▁ and ▁ seventy ▁ stems ▁ of ▁ palm-trees; ▁ and ▁ they ▁ encamped ▁ there ▁ by ▁ the ▁ waters .
▁ and ▁ jonathan ▁ smote ▁ nasib ▁ the ▁ philistine ▁ that ▁ dwelt ▁ in ▁ the ▁ hill; ▁ and ▁ the ▁ philistines ▁ hear ▁ of ▁ it, ▁ and ▁ saul ▁ sounds ▁ the ▁ trumpet ▁ through ▁ all ▁ the ▁ land, ▁ saying, ▁ the ▁ servants ▁ have ▁ despised ▁ us .
▁ friends ▁ will ▁ hate ▁ poor ▁ friends; ▁ but ▁ the ▁ friends ▁ of ▁ the ▁ rich ▁ are ▁ many .
▁ for ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ been ▁ a ▁ helper ▁ to ▁ every ▁ lowly ▁ city, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ shelter ▁ to ▁ them ▁ that ▁ were ▁ disheartened ▁ by ▁ reason ▁ of ▁ poverty: ▁ thou ▁ shalt ▁ deliver ▁ them ▁ from ▁ wicked ▁ men: ▁ thou ▁ hast ▁ been ▁ a ▁ shelter ▁ of ▁ them ▁ that ▁ thirst, ▁ and ▁ a ▁ refreshing ▁ air ▁ to ▁ injured ▁ men .
▁ when ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ saw ▁ her, ▁ he ▁ had ▁ compassion ▁ on ▁ her, ▁ and ▁ said ▁ to ▁ her, ▁ 'don't ▁ cry . '
▁ he ▁ shall ▁ summon ▁ the ▁ heaven ▁ above, ▁ and ▁ the ▁ earth, ▁ that ▁ he ▁ may ▁ judge ▁ his ▁ people .
▁ he ▁ sends ▁ forth ▁ his ▁ fountains ▁ among ▁ the ▁ valleys: ▁ the ▁ waters ▁ shall ▁ run ▁ between ▁ the ▁ mountains .

▁ and ▁ if ▁ i ▁ should ▁ say, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ forget ▁ to ▁ speak, ▁ i ▁ will ▁ bow ▁ down ▁ my ▁ face ▁ and ▁ groan;
▁ may ▁ he ▁ deliver ▁ them ▁ from ▁ the ▁ wiles ▁ of ▁ the ▁ devil ▁ and ▁ of ▁ evil-doing ▁ men,
▁ as ▁ also ▁ in ▁ all ▁ of ▁ his ▁ letters, ▁ speaking ▁ in ▁ them ▁ of ▁ these ▁ things . ▁ in ▁ those, ▁ there ▁ are ▁ some ▁ things ▁ that ▁ are ▁ hard ▁ to ▁ understand, ▁ which ▁ the ▁ ignorant ▁ and ▁ unsettled ▁ twist, ▁ as ▁ they ▁ also ▁ do ▁ to ▁ the ▁ other ▁ scriptures, ▁ to ▁ their ▁ own ▁ destruction .

▁ and ▁ the ▁ lord ▁ smote ▁ the ▁ people ▁ for ▁ the ▁ making ▁ the ▁ calf, ▁ which ▁ aaron ▁ made .
