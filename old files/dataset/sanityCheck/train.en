There is implanted in a holy man the earnest desire to learn,
which is partly natural and partly voluntary, and these qualities are equally clearly distinguished.
The holy man setteth up virtue, and he wisheth to instruct his neighbours by the (examples of) others who have lived from the earliest times, and who have given thanks to Him that hath done good unto us all from the beginning, that is to say, to our God and our Lord Jesus the Christ,
those whom He hath....................
I mean that not all have given thanks.
We are those (unto whom) He doeth good. And there are very many admonitions (or, teachings), and acts of valiant and blessed men which have come down to us in the Holy Scriptures, which are like unto images that have souls in them, and which will make those who wish to follow them resemble [them] in their glorious integrity, and prevent them from becoming feeble in the performance of their mighty deeds.
The men about whom I shall now write to you are men who maintained their virtuous deeds in our own time, and who did not slacken in their integrity and valiant behavior.
And there was in the kingdom of the Emperor Trajan, wherein the worship of idols had spread and prevailed,
a certain general whose name was Plaketas (Placidus) He was near of kin to the king, and he belonged to a very great and noble family, according to (the opinion) of this world, and he was exceedingly rich.
And he exceeded all the other nobles of the palace in his possessions, (in) gold, and (in) silver, and he had troops of slaves, and riches of all kinds in very great abundance;
and by race he was a Greek And he was adorned with all the works of righteousness.
Those who were in distress, he relieved.
And he had a wife who was herself a worshipper of idols,
but she was adorned with every excellent quality and virtue in exactly the same degree (as her husband);
and two sons were born to them,
and these they brought up to walk in the same good path as their parents.
And the man was exceedingly well known because of the good works which he was in the habit of doing,
and he was so celebrated for his personal strength and valour that the Barbarians were afraid at the mere mention of his name. For he was a fine fighter,
and he had gained great renown in battles of all kinds,
but his whole desire was to hunt and slay wild animals, and for this he was greatly esteemed.
But the Good God, who loveth every man who is worthy of Him in every place, did not forget the deeds of this good man,
neither did He wish to destroy his good disposition,
but even as it is written, 'Every heathen who feareth God, and who worketh righteousness, shall be accepted by Him,'
His bowels of compassion yearned towards him, and He was merciful towards him to such a degree that God willed to save his life, and He did so in the way and by the means which I will here declare unto you.
And it came to pass that on a certain day the man went out, according to his custom, to hunt wild beasts in the mountain,
he and his soldiers, and all his slaves were with him.
And there appeared unto him a herd of deer that were feeding,
And when Plaketas had seen him,
he wished to take him in a snare.
And he took with him certain soldiers, and hid away all the others, and he gave chase to the animal.
Now the soldiers who had gone with him became exhausted, and they gave up the chase, and Plaketas rode into the thicket alone in pursuit of the beast.
And by the good Providence of God neither he nor the horse on which he was riding became exhausted in that dense thicket.
And when he had persevered for some time in his pursuit, an was a very long way off from his companions,
then the beast stood still upon a very high mountain.
And when the general had approached him, he stood still and looked round about on every side,
and he wondered by what means he could take him in a snare.
And God, the Lover of mankind, Who effecteth the salvation of man in very many ways,
snared this (general) in His net, even as was snared Cornelius by Peter, and even as was Paul unto whom He appeared when he was persecuting Him.
And when a considerable time had passed, during which Plaketas had been looking at the stag, and marvelling at its great size and very fine appearance, and thinking out the means whereby he might capture it, the Lord gave him the following sign; and He made him able to see it,
and it appeared unto him in the following form.
There was a figure of a cross between the stag's horns,
and it shone more brightly than the sun,
and there was, moreover, between his horns a similitude like unto the body wherein God arrayed Himself in the womb of the Virgin;
now He clothed Himself in this body for our salvation.
And He cried out to Plaketas from the animal with the voice of a man,
saying, 'O Plaketas, why dost thou hunt Me?
For it is for thine own sake that I have appeared unto thee 'in the form of this animal.
 I am Jesus, He Whom thou servest, without knowing it.
Thy kind and charitable deeds which thou doest have come before Me.
Therefore I have Myself appeared unto thee,
and I have snared thee by means of this animal that is without reasoning power.
And I have netted thee with the nets of My Godhead.
It is not just to allow those who love Me by their good deeds to act as slaves to unclean demons, and idols which are dead, and dumb, and without feeling.
For this reason did I come upon the earth in the form wherein thou now seest Me, for I wish to deliver (or, save) the race of man.'
And when Plaketas heard these things he was terrified, and he fell down upon the ground.
And when a long time had passed, he rose up, wishing to understand with exactness the miracle which had taken place.
And he said, 'What then is the sight which I have seen?
And what manner of voice is this which I have heard?
Make Thyself manifest to me, O Thou Who speakest with me, and I will believe in Thee.'
When Plaketas heard these words he fell down upon his face and cried out, saying, 'I believe, Lord, that Thou art He Who hath created everything, and that Thou are He Who turneth back those who go astray,
and that Thou art He Who giveth life unto those who are dead.'
And the Lord answered and said, 'If thou believest, go, make thy way to the high priest of the Christians, and demand from him the freely-given gift of baptism.'
And Plaketas answered and said unto Him, 'Lord, command me to relate these words to my wife and children, so that they also may believe in Thee.'
And the Lord said unto him, 'Repeat them.
And ye shall be purified from every unclean thing When ye have received the seal of baptism thou shalt return hither, and I will appear unto thee, and I will declare unto thee the mystery of salvation.'
And Plaketas came down from the mountain,
and went into his house.
And when the evening had come he began to speak and tell his wife and sons about the things which he had seen in the vision, and how the Lord had appeared unto him.
And his wife cried out and said unto him, 'Lord, my brother, thou hast seen God Whom they crucified, Whom the Christians worship.
For He is the only true God, and it is He Who delivereth those who put their hopes in Him.'
And she cried out vehemently, saying, 'Have mercy upon me, O Lord Jesus the Christ, and upon my two sons also.'
And she said unto her husband, In the night which hath passed I myself also saw Him, and He said unto me, To-morrow do thou, and thy husband, and your sons come to Me.
Therefore come this very night, and let us go and receive baptism from the high priest of the Christians, even as thou wast commanded,
for by this do those who believe in Him become members of his household.'
And Plaketas answered, saying, 'This is what He Who appeared unto me commanded.'
And in the middle of that night they took their two sons secretly, and a few of their slaves,
and they went to the high priest of the Christians, and they told him all the dream,
and they confessed their belief in the Lord Jesus the Christ,
and they entreated him to give them the seal of the Christ by baptism.
And the high priest rejoiced, and ascribed glory to God Who wisheth all men to have life, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
And the high priest took them, and catechized them, and gave into their hands the Holy Mysteries of the Faith, and he baptized them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
And to Plaketas he gave the name of Eusthathius, and to his wife Theopiste; his elder son he called Agapius, and the younger Theopistus;
and he gave them the Glorious Body and Blood of the Christ, and dismissed them,
saying, 'May God, the Christ, be with you,
and may He graciously grant unto you His kingdom for ever.
And know that the hand of the Lord is with you,
and I earnestly beseech you that when ye shall be in Paradise ye remember the soul of John, the least of all men and the most miserable.'
And when the morning had come Eusthathius took horses,
and he departed to the mountain, and went toward the spot wherein he had seen the vision.
And he dismissed his soldiers, and sent them away to hunt the wild animals,
and he remained where he was alone for a short time;
then he moved on,
and went nearer and nearer to the place where he had seen the figure at first.
And he cast himself down upon his face, and he cried out, saying, 'Lord, I know that Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God, and I believe in Thee and in Thy Good Father, and in the Holy Spirit.
And now I beseech Thee,
if I be worthy of the holy grace of Thy Godhead, declare unto me the things which Thou hast to say unto me.'
And straightway the Lord answered and said unto him, 'Blessed art thou, O Plaketas, because thou hast received the washing of grace,
and hast arrayed thyself in the indestructible garment which abideth for ever.
Now, therefore, do thou make manifest the work of thy faith.
Since the Devil is envious of thee thou must cast him behind thee;
and he will be zealous in setting snares of every kind for thee, and he will contend against thee.
For thou must of necessity endure manifold temptations.
If thou endurest them in patience thou shalt receive the crown of victory.
Behold, thou shalt rise very much higher in the works (or, affairs) of (this) life, and in the riches which are temporal.
And, moreover, thou shalt become rich in spiritual excellence.
Now be not weak, neither be thou overcome by the glory of this world, which thou didst possess originally;
but as thou didst shew thyself to be a mighty man among men, and as thou didst wage war, and didst strive zealously to serve a king who is mortal, even so do thou strive zealously to prove thyself to be a mighty man against the Devil, and do thou keep fast hold on the faith for Me,
And when the Lord had said these things unto him
He departed into heaven,
and the Lord spake unto him, saying, 'Eusthathius, there shall be unto thee as great a temptation as thou canst wish in that which thou shalt have in the last days.'
And Eusthathius said unto Him, 'If this be the last of my days, I now beseech Thee, O my Lord, supposing that I am not able to bear the things which Thou hast appointed me, to remoe them, and not to let them come upon me, and command that our temptation return unto Thee.
But give us strength, O Lord, Thou God of mighty deeds, for Thou are He in Whom we trust.'
And the Lord said unto him, 'Fight, O Eusthathius, and My grace shall watch over what is in (thy) heart.'
And Saint Eusthathius came down from the mountain,
and he went into his house, and told his wife the things which God had said unto him.
And they knelt down together on their knees,
and they prayed, saying, 'Let Thy will be done.'
And it came to pass, after a few days, that a pestilence broke out in the house of Eusthathius, and all his slaves died.
And when this had happened, Eusthathius perceived that there had actually come upon him the temptation (or, trial) which, according to the indications that had already been given to him, was to come upon him, and he welcomed it as such, and he rejoiced, and exhorted his wife not to lose courage.
And after a little while all his horses, and cattle, and sheep died,
and this temptation he also received with joy.
And it came to pass in those days that all the people were celebrating a festival, and they were rejoicing greatly because they had conquered the Persians,
and the Emperor was celebrating the festival with them with great heartiness,
but Eustathius felt that it was not seemly for him to join them in celebrating the festival.
As, however, he was a great general among the nobles of Rome, the Emperor enquired for him, but did not find him.
And when the Emperor learned that in one hour nothing had been left to him of all his possessions,
and that neither he nor those who were with him had anything left,
he and all the nobles with him were exceedingly sorry on his account,
and they marvelled at what had happened to him.
Then his wife said unto him, 'How long shall we sit here in this place?
Rise up, and let us take oiur sons who are left unto us, and let us depart and leave this country, because we have become the laughing-stock of those who know us.'
And that night they took their sons and departed, and they set out for Egypt.
And when they had been travelling for a day or two, they arrived at the sea,
and they found a ship anchored at the quay, and they made enquiries aboiut embarking in the ship.
And the captain of the ship was a savage and brutal man.
And when they had embarked in the ship they put to sea,
and the captain of the ship looked upon the wife of Eustathius, and he saw that her face was beautiful, and he loved her.
And when the captain arrived at the shore of the sea he asked Eustathius for his passage money, but he had it not to give to him;
and he seized the wife of Eustathius in place of the passage money,
for he had already determined that he would not let her go with her husband.
And when Eustathius persevered in arguing the matter with him, and in making supplication to him, the captain made a sign to the sailors to lay hold upon him, and to throw him into the sea.
And when Eustathius knew of their evil intentions he very unwillingly left his wife behind, and taking his two sons departed with them weeping,
and he made lamentation, saying, 'Woe is me, O my sons, for your mother hath been seized by a barbarian.'
And he went away heaving sighs and shedding tears, and he came to a river of water, and owing to the heavy rain which had fallen into it
he was unable to swim across it with both of his sons at the same time.
And he took the one son on his neck,
and leaving the other on this side of the river
he swam across the water, and left on the other side the son whom he had been carrying,
and then turned back (to fetch) the other.
And it came to pass that whilst he was in the middle of the river
And when certain shepherds saw the (one) child in the jaws of the lion and that he was uninjured,
they said with right understanding, The Providence of God is disposed to protect this boy,
and to help him, and it will deliver him from the wild beast.'
And they gave chase to the lion with their horses,
and the lion was afraid.
And by the dispensation of God the lion dropped the child from his mouth,
and fled, and the shepherds picked up the child, and they reared it as a son to them on the east of the river.
And as for the other son which the wolf had carried off
the good Providence of God preserved him also unharmed.
For when certain men who were ploughing the land saw him (being carried off) they gave chase to the wolf, and took him from the beast; and the child had received no injury whatsoever.
And the ploughmen and the shepherds were living together in the same village,
and they took the two little children, and reared them as their own.
Now Eustathius had no knowledge whatsoever of what had happened;
but he walked on his way, and he wept, and kept repeating these words, 'Woe is me!
I was at one time flourishing like a tree,
but now I am dried up and withered.
Woe is me! I, who at one time had legions of soldiers at my feet, am now left utterly to myself,
and neither my wife nor my children are permitted to be with me.
But do not, O Lord, cast me away,
and be not Thou forgetful of my tears.
O Lord, Thou didst say unto me, 'Needs must that thou shalt be tempted as was Job.'
And behold, do Thou look upon my sufferings which have become exceedingly severe.
For even if the possessions which he had were all carried away, there still remained to him the dung-hill whereon he could seat himself,
whereas I am a miserable sojourner in a strange land, and am burdened with all this mass of misery.
And even if his branches, I mean his children, were lopped off, he still had left to him the root, that is to say, his wife, who would live in the house with him, even though she did not serve him as a wife in the (true sense of) the word.
But as for me, miserable man that I am, my root is cut off on all sides,
and I cannot see a single ray of light from the lamp of my race.
Moreover, I am like a tree in the desert, which is being ever shaken by the winds of the Devil.
Do not, Lord, do not afflict Thy servant, (and drive him) to utter many words,
for if I spake the things which I ought not to speak, I should be grieved in heart.
Do Thou, therefore, O Lord, set a guard upon my mouth, and a strong seal upon my lips, so that my heart might not incline towards the words which are evil,
and Thou mayest not cast me away from before Thy face. And give Thou me rest, O Lord!'
And as he was saying these things, and was heaving sighs and weeping, he came to a village, which was called Bassos,
and he went into it, and worked there, and procured his daily bread therein.
And when he had lived there a long time the owners of the village entreated him to go and become watchman of the fruit crops in the orchard there, and he fullfilled this work for a period of ten years, and received his wages for the same.
And his sons were being fed and brought up in the village which we have already mentioned, and they did not know that they were brethren.
And the captain of the ship who had carried off the wife of Eustathius took her to his own country,
and the great shadow of God overshadowed her so completely that the barbarian was never able to touch her all that time.
For what this woman had entreated God to grant her was that a pagan man should not touch her at all.
The subject of this festival to-day is full of joy, for it is our holy father, who had put on Christ, Apa Pisentius, who was full of light; and who spread abroad a sweet odour at all times, not only during the day, but during the night also.
All the beasts which are upon the earth, and (all) the birds which are in the heavens rejoice, and move about gladly, and are happy this day because of the good and glorious news of him which hath reached them, according to what the words shall inform us, if we are able to proceed to the end.
I took an oath to keep silence and not to speak concerning thy righteous acts and judgements, because thou thyself didst flee from the adulations of men from the very beginning, when thou didst become a monk, and before thou didst become a bishop.
And indeed if we were all to be gathered together, each one having the opportunity of speaking, one would declare (the greatness of) his knowledge, and another his power of disputation, and another would proclaim his power of revealing hidden things; and thus it would happen that all the descriptions (of him) would be laudatory.
Saint James the Apostle cried out in his Catholic Epistle, saying, 'He who knoweth how to do what is good, and doeth it not, it is a sin unto him.'
Let us learn, moreover, who it was to whom the Apostle (Paul) referred in his words, I knew a man in Christ fourteen years ago,
but whether he be in the body I know not, or whether he be out of the body I know not, it is only God Who knoweth, (this man I say) was caught up into the third heaven.
And I knew such a man, but whether he be in the body (now), or whether he be out of the body (now) I know not, it is only God Who knoweth, (this man I say) was caught up into Paradise, and heard things which were hidden,
the which it is not lawful for man to utter.
Of whom then was the Apostle speaking if it was not Pisentius?
For all the saints have fled from the glory (or, adulation) of this world, and this did also our glorious father, Apa Pisentius, whom God hath made manifest to us in our own days.
He was a giver of light to the whole world.
He was salt which was purified for every one, according to that which is written in the Gospel, 'Ye are the salt of the earth.
Now if the salt hath become tasteless, wherewith shall they make it salt (again)?
And again, 'Ye are the light of the world.'
He hid his life and the works thereof, but God hath made manifest those who perform His will and commandments, generation after generation, according to that which is written,
God draweth nigh to every one who crieth out to Him in truth, and He doeth the will of every one who holdeth Him in fear, and He will hear their supplication, and will deliver them.'
Now if ye wish to know whether he hated the glory (or, adulation) which was vain, and whether he wished not for any to applaud him in any way or not, go into... and learn concerning him from the acts of his life and the manner in which he used to live.
Then he asked them, saying, 'Have ye any decided reason for coming into this region?'
And they answered, saying, 'In the first place, we set out in order to come to thee, and to pay thee a visit, and to receive thy
For had it not been for the cares of the world which have occupied us for several days past we should have passed thy way before this.
In the second place, we have a little business in this neighbourhood which we wish to arrange ; but do thou pray on our behalf, O father, that God may journey with us.
If God be pleased to permit us to do this we shall return to thee again, and we wiU salute (or, kiss) thee, and receive thy blessing before we return to our houses, if it be God's will.'
y sons, take ye good heed to yourselves in these villages.
Hold no intercourse with a woman who is bad.
Do not seize the ox of the poor.
If there be any man in this region who is indebted to you, do not treat him harshly, and do not attempt to force him to pay by legal means;
but watch what is in (his) mind, in order that God may shew compassion unto you.'
And they answered, saying, 'Pray for us, O our father.'
And they came away from his presence, and they acted (according to) his plan (or, way), and they gave glory to God because of the words of advice wherewith he had advised them.
And when they had come to him, they heard him reciting the words of Saint Jeremiah with great calmness and clearness,
and they sat down outside his place of abode for a little time, saying, 'It is not right, and the matter is not of such urgency as to make it seemly for us to cry out to the holy man inside until he hath finished reciting the Scriptures and praying
And when Pisentius had concluded the reciting of the Prophet Jeremiah, and had finished (his prayer), the two men rose up and knocked at the door, at the very moment when he began to (recite) the (Book of the) Prophet Ezekiel.
And they sat down, and did not cry out to Pisentius inside.
And finally he finished reciting the whole of the (Book of) the Prophet (Ezekiel), and he shut his mouth, for the evening had come.
And when the two men knocked at the door, Pisentius answered them, saying, 'Bless me.'
And he looked out upon them from a large window, and he spake unto them, saying, 'Did ye come to this place many hours ago?'
And they said unto him, 'We came here at dawn, but we did not dare to cry out to thee inside until thou hadst finished thy recital (of the Scriptures)
Then straightway Apa Pisentius wept, and smote upon his breast, and said unto them,' This day I deserve a very great punishment, and all the labours which I have performed are things of vanity.'
Now these things which the holy man spake (shew) that he fled from the vain adulations of men.
He was very sad at heart, but the two men knew that he was reciting (the Books of Jeremiah and Ezekiel).
Know ye therefore, O my beloved, that the saints crave for the glory of God only.
If ye will not (believe me), hearken unto the honey-sweet writer David who saith, 'I have desired Thy commandments;
look Thou upon me and have compassion upon me.'
And the truly wise man Paul cried out, saying, 'For we groan in this earnestly desiring to array ourselves in our place of abode which is from heaven.
Hearken also to this great miracle which took place by his I hands when he was a monk living in quiet contemplation in his cell and before he became a bishop.
He was suffering from his spleen on one occasion on the third day of the festival at the end of Easter,
but he did not make known to any one of the brethren that he was sick, but he sent them a message and said, 'Pray for me.
I am going to the monastery of Apa Abraham to visit the brethren who are in that place.
If the Lord be pleased to permit it I shall return to you.'
Now he spake in this wise because he did not wish to let any one know that he was seriously ill.
Now if any man shall ask in a spirit of contentiousness why the holy man said this,
let him read in the Book of Job the Blessed, and he will find that the Lord said unto him, 'I have not done these things unto thee for any other purpose except to make thee shew thyself to be righteous/
And Paul himself said, ' I have done all these things for the sake of the Gospel, that I might be to him a companion.'
Now when the holy man Apa Pisentius had been sick. for a whole week, and the brethren had made no enquiries after him, for they thought he was in a cave,
they held converse with each other, saying, 'Pisentius tarrieth somewhat over long, let us enquire about him.
Perhaps he hath fallen sick on the road, or perhaps some suffering hath afflicted him, and he is unable to walk.
And they sent a brother who was a priest to make enquiries about him.
Now when Pisentius had departed, according to the dispensation of God—now observe ye the wonderful acts of God—
all the days which he had passed lying on his bed sick, during which the holy men did not minister unto him, until the very day wherein the brother went to him...
Now when the brother went to him, he found the door of the little cell wherein he lived open.
And when the brother had waited for some time, he rose up and called out to (the dweller) inside, 'Bless me.'
Know ye then, O my beloved, that him that keepeth the commandments of monasticising, and fulfilleth them without sluggishness, doth the Christ love.
His holy ones do not speak to Him only, but they see God, each one in the vision which appeareth unto him, according to the form wherein He wisheth to make Himself manifest to them.
Now as concerneth Jacob the Patriarch. When Rebecca had heard the words of Esau, her eldest son, who was wroth with Jacob because of the blessing wherewith Isaac had blessed him, she cried out to him, and said unto him,
Behold thy brother (Esau) is older than thou, and the blessing wherewith Isaac, who is thy father, hath blessed thee (belongeth to him).
Now therefore, arise, and get thee gone into Mesopotamia of Syria, to Laban my brother, and do thou abide with him until the fury of the wrath of thy brother hath turned away from thee, lest peradventure I become childless in respect of both of you at once, and on the same day
And Isaac also commanded him (thus), and he came out (to) Jacob and set him on his way, saying, 'Depart into Mesopotamia'
And it came to pass that he arrived at a certain place, and he lay down (there); now the sun had set.
And when he had placed a stone under his head, he lay down and fell asleep, and that night he dreamed a dream.
And he saw a cloud fixed upon the earth, and the top thereof reached into the heavens;
and the angels of God were ascending and descending upon it.
Now God was standing upon it, and He made Himself manifest to Jacob ne on that night, and He spake with him.
Now when Jacob had gone into Mesopotamia of Syria, God spake again with him in the night season, saying, ' Lift up thine eyes and look with them, and thou shalt see that I will come to the white sheep,
and the (white) sheep shall be with the goats, and they shall bring forth young of variegated colours, and they shall be in colour like ashes, and (some) sheep shall be marked with stars (i.e. spots).'
And again God spake unto him in a vision of the night, saying, 'I am the God of Isaac; fear thou not.
Thou shalt certainly increase and multiply, and thou shalt fill the earth, and thou shalt become the lord thereof.'
And when God had blessed him with gold, and silver, and sheep, and goats, and cattle of every kind.
He spake again unto him, saying, 'Get thee back into thy house; I will be with thee.'
Now when the morning had come Jacob said unto him, 'Shew me thy name.'
And the man said unto him, 'Why dost thou enquire concerning my name?'
Now this is a most wonderful thing.
And the man said unto Jacob, 'Let me go, for the daylight is growing stronger.'
And Jacob said unto him, 'I will not let thee go whilst as yet thou hast not blessed me'
And the man said unto Jacob, 'What is the name which thou hast?'
And the man said unto Jacob, 'They shall no more call thee Jacob, but Israel, which is the name which thou shalt have; for thou hast prevailed with God, and thou (shalt be) mighty with men'
And the man touched the side of a member of Jacob, and that member became without feeling.
Then Jacob said, 'I have seen God face to face.'
My soul is delivered.' Now the sun was rising upon him when he passed the Image of God.
And, O my beloved, it is right that for us this should suffice.
If God deemed him worthy thereof, and came down into the world, and spake unto the creature which He had fashioned concerning his restoration with salvation of soul, how very much more will He not send His saints to comfort (His servants) in their sufferings?
Therefore let no man allow himself to be unbelieving concerning this matter which I have related unto him concerning the holy man Apa Pisentius the bishop, for he was worthy to see Elijah the Tishbite.
But do Thou help us, for Thou art able to help us by what Thou canst do; have compassion upon us.'
Jesus said unto him, 'Everything is possible for him that believeth.'
And the father of the young man cried out, 'I believe. Help thou mine unbelief.'
Then straightway (Jesus) rebuked the evil spirit, and cast him out from the young man because his father believed.
And again it was by the might of faith that a certain woman went to Him, whose blood had been flowing from her for twelve years, and whom no man had been able to heal.
She touched only the outer edge of His garment, and immediately her blood ceased to flow, and dried up.
Then He spake unto her, saying, 'It is thy faith which hath delivered thee; go in peace.'
And again He spake unto the disciples, saying, 'If ye have faith as large as a grain of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove thyself from this place to that, and it shall remove itself, and there is nothing which shall be impossible for you.'
And again, if ye shall say to a sycamore tree. Separate thyself (from) the earth, and plant thyself in the sea, it shall hearken unto you.'
And moreover, it is said concerning the holy man Apa Pisentius, that it came to pass on a time when he was young, while he was pasturing his father's sheep, that God opened his eyes, and he saw a pillar of fire in front of him.
Now there were certain other young men who were pasturing sheep with him.
And he said unto the other young men who were pasturing sheep with him, 'Do ye see the pillar of fire on the road in front of us?'
Now since God came unto Apa Pisentius when he was a young man, He chose him even as He did Samuel, whose mother had given him to the temple of God according to her vow, even as the holy Psalmist saith, 'Moses, the holy man, and Aaron among His priests, and Samuel among those who called upon His Name.
They cried out to God, and He heard them, and He spake unto them out of the pillar of cloud, and they kept His testimonies, and the ordinances which He had given unto them.
Then the holy man Apa Pisentius himself took his water-pot to fill it with water, for it was the time for filling (the water-pots with) water.
And whilst Apa Pisentius was filling his water-pot, according to what he confessed to us with his own mouth, and testified to us, he I captured the fish, and (when) he gave it to the brother he said unto him, 'God hath fulfilled thy petition
it was He Who sent the meal to Daniel, for which his heart waited.
He said, 'It is He moreover Who hath prepared the fish for thee this day by His wish, inasmuch as He would not allow thee to suffer grief in respect of that for which thou didst ask at His hand.
Well and truly doth the Prophet say, God is nigh unto every one, and He directeth him in truth.
And He will hearken unto their supplications, and will deliver them.
God shall guard every one who loveth Him.'
When the children of Israel had risen up against Moses and Aaron, they said unto him, 'What is this that thou hast done with us?'
Thou hast brought us forth from the land of Egypt.
We used to sit down by the brazen pots of flesh, and we ate bread, and now the people have to be satisfied with manna instead of with loaves of bread and pieces of flesh.
If not (i. e. if thou dost not give us bread and flesh) we will stone you. And the whole congregation spake the word to stone them.
And Moses cried out to God, saying, ' O God, where shall I find the wherewithal to give unto this people so that they may eat?
Only a very little more and they will stone me.'
And God spake unto Moses, saying, 'I have heard the murmurings which the children of Israel have made against you.
Ye must know, therefore, O my beloved, that the supplication of the righteous man is exceedingly powerful, and it effecteth much, even as it is written.
Now as concerneth Moses, the Lawgiver of the Old Covenant, immediately that he cried out to God concerning the multitude (of the Israelites), God did according to his wish.
So also was it in the case of the Lawgiver of the New Covenant, Apa Pisentius.
Immediately he made supplication to God on behalf of the brother who was a monk, God did not cause him grief, but fulfilled his petition, even according to that which is written in the Psalm, 'The Lord shall fulfil all thy petitions,'
Hearken moreover to the account of another great and wonderful thing which took place through the holy man Apa Pisentius, when he was a monk, and before he became a bishop.
It came to pass on a certain day that he went to the well at which the brethren were in the habit of drinking, in order that he might fill his water-pot.
Now when he had come to the mouth of the well, he (found that he) had forgotten the rope and the leather bucket, and had not brought them with him.
And when he had stood up at the mouth of the well he prayed to God according to the custom of the brethren, and he said, 'God, Thou knowest well that it is impossible for me to turn back again into the monastery to fetch the rope.
But do Thou command this water to rise up to where I am so that I may be able to fill my water-pot therewith, so that I may serve Thee for the remainder of my days.
For Thou didst command Thy Apostle Peter, saying, Walk on the water
Now when he had finished his prayer, the water rose in the well until it reached the mouth of the well, and he filled his water-pot with water.
Now whilst the water was sinking downwards, a certain shepherd, who was pasturing his flock of sheep among the thorn bushes, directed his steps to the mouth of the well, and he looked in, and he saw the water going down by degrees until it reached its place at the bottom.
Unto whom shall I liken thee, O blessed Apa Pisentius?
Verily thou art like unto Moses, the Lawgiver, who made the sea to be divided, one half being on this side, and the other on that, and the children of Israel walked in the midst thereof as upon dry ground
and the water was to them a wall of water on this side and on that, on the right hand and on the left.
It was Moses who spake to the rock, and it sent forth fountains of water.
And as for thee, O holy man Apa Pisentius, thy prayer entered into the vault of heaven, and it fulfilled the Scripture, which saith, 'It was He Who spake, and they came into being; it was He Who commanded, and they were created
Thou wast a man of foresight like unto the Prophets, and a man of intellect like unto the Apostles, and thou wast a wise steward.
Therefore wast thou worthy of the Church of the Saints.
God made thee to keep alive a multitude of souls.
Thou didst preach the Gospel like Paul, and thou didst preach in wisdom the orthodox Faith. And thou didst cry out in thy discourse like a herald, thou didst shout aloud in thy wisdom like a trumpet.
Who is able to pay unto thee the honour of which thou art worthy, O just and holy man?
For thou didst know the things which were hidden before they took place.
Thy discourse which appertained to the things of this world had therein songs and parables ; thy discourse which appertained to the monkish estate (was full of) spiritual explanations.
Thy words were those of a ruler, parables and mysteries.
Thou didst never feel ashamed because of them before any man, according to that which is written, 'My words shall be testimonies concerning Thee before kings, I shall not be ashamed.'
Thou wast a father to multitudes of the poor in our time, and the father of those who were orphans in our days.
Thou didst proclaim like a herald peace unto those who were afar off, O thou God-loving father, Apa Pisentius.
And thou didst exercise (or, train) those who drew nigh unto thee in the doctrine which was sound.
Thou wast a well-skilled spiritual merchant, and therefore thou didst bestow graciously thy good gifts upon every one with great gladness and readiness.
Thou didst seek and thou didst find, O God-loving father, Apa Pisentius, thou leader of the truth.
Thou didst knock and it was opened unto thee ; thou didst petition God, and He granted thee all thy petitions.
The Governors desired eagerly (to hear) thy discourse, and all the proselytes sought eagerly after thy mysteries.
Thou didst look upon (?) the man whose name was Anatoles.
And they debated the matter together, saying, 'Who then is there that can command him (to accept)? It is not a man'
Then they took counsel together, saying, 'Let us relate the matter to the holy man Apa Colluthus, who is a great one among men; he shall reveal the matter to him (in its true light), and he will not hide the business from him'
O man, flee quickly from sin, and remember death immediately.
For it is written, 'A wise man suppresseth sin, and the face of the ascetic shall shine like the sun.'
Moreover, remember Moses, who chose to suffer with the people of God rather than to enjoy the I pleasures of sin for a time.
If thou lovest the suffering of the saints, they will make themselves to be companions of thine, and they will minister on thy behalf before God.
And He will grant thee every good thing for which thou dost petition, because thou hast taken up thy cross, and hast followed thy Lord.
Do not seek after a seat of glory among men, so that God may shelter thee from the blast of the storm of which thou knowest nothing, and may apportion thee a seat in His metropolis, Jerusalem of heaven.
Test everything.
Lay hold upon that which is good. Similarly, do not treat with contempt the image of God.
Moreover, keep diligently thy youth with all care, in order that thou mayest be able to keep diligently thine old age with all care, lest thou be put to shame, and thou come to an end in the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
The whole creation of God shall look upon thee, and they shall revile thee, saying,
 We used to think about thee every day, and believe that thou wast a sheep, but we find thee to be a wolf in this place. Get thee gone now into the pit of Amente, cast thyself down now into the heart of the earth.
O what great shame! Whilst thou didst walk in the world men gave glory to thee thinking that thou wast a man of moral excellence; the moment, however, that thou comest to the Valley of Jehoshaphat, the place of judgement, thou art found to be naked.
And every one looketh upon thy sins, and upon thy shame which is revealed to God and man.
Woe be unto thee in that hour! Whither wilt thou turn thy face?
Or, supposing that thou canst open thy mouth, what wilt thou say? Thy sins have sealed thy soul, which is black like unto sackcloth.
What wilt thou do in that hour? Thou wilt weep, but they will not accept weeping from thee. Thou wilt make supplication, but they will not accept supplication from thee because the beings into whose hands thou shalt be given are merciless.
O woe be unto thee in that hour wherein thou shalt hear that terrible voice which shall give judgement, saying, 'Let the sinners return to Amente.'
And again, 'Depart ye from Me, O ye accursed, into the everlasting fire which hath been prepared for the Devil and his angels.'
And again, 'Those who commit transgressions, and all those who work iniquity, do I hate, and I will destroy them out of the city of God'
Now therefore, O my son, make use of this world, but despise it as thou doest so, and walk therein holding it to be a thing of no account.
Follow thou the Lord in everything, and thou shalt find boldness of speech in the Valley of Jehoshaphat.
Flee not unto any being of flesh whatsoever, because when the stone striketh upon the fire breaketh out, and it burneth up very much substance.
Flee thou to the Lord at every hour, sit thou down in the shadow of Him, for he who abideth in the help of the Most High shall be under the shadow of the God of heaven, and he shall never be moved.
Remember thou the Lord and the Jerusalem of heaven; let (the memorial thereof) go up in thy heart, and thou shalt be under the blessing of heaven, and the glory of God shall support thee.
Keep thou thy body and thy heart with the greatest diligence.
Follow after peace and humility, and if these are bound together (in thee) they will make thee to see God.
For it is written, 'Seek after peace and purity, for they are bound together.
And again it is written, 'And even if I have all the faith, so that (I can) remove a mountain, without love of heart, I am benefited in nothing.
O man, wherefore art thou envious of the glory which is empty?
Or (why art thou) a lover of money, or (a lover) of magnificence, wherewith the Enemy bindeth thee in fetters, and maketh thee a stranger unto God?
What kind of apology wilt thou be able to make to the Christ when He shall say unto thee, 'Inasmuch as thou hatest thy brother, it is I Whom thou hatest?
And as for thee, thou shalt depart into the punishment which is for ever, for thou art an enemy of thy brother;
O my beloved, let us flee to the feet of the Gospel of the True Law of God, the Christ, and let us hearken unto Him, saying, 'Condemn not, that ye be not condemned.'
Forgive, that ye may be forgiven.
If thou dost not forgive, they will not forgive thee.
If thou wilt bind thy brother, prepare thyself for punishment for thy slippings aside, and for thy transgressions, and for thy fornications which thou didst commit secretly, and thy thefts, and thy obscene words, and thy evil thoughts, and thine avariciousness, (and) the evil things which thou wilt have to explain before the throne of the Christ.
The whole of God's creation will be gazing at thee, all the angels, and all the hosts of heaven will be standing there, with their swords drawn, and they will compel thee to make excuses for and to confess thy sins.
Thine apparel shall be motley, thy mouth shall be shut, thou shalt be terrorstricken to such a degree that thou shalt be unable to speak or to explain.
O wretched man, thy many fornications, which were the disease (?) of thy soul, and the lusts of the eye,
and the evil cogitations which afflict the spirit and cause grief to the soul, and the slip in the speech (or, mouth), and the tongue which speaketh words of boasting and defileth the whole body,
and the evil words of scurrility and indecency, and the gossipings which are inspired by envy and hatred, and the scoffings, and the derisive words about the image of God,
 and the voluntary revilings (or, condemnations) which will deprive thee of the good things of Paradise, and the secret passions which it would be a disgrace to mention, the evil thought towards the image of God,
and the anger, and discord, and impudence, and arrogance, and the thoughts of the heart (which sprang) from wickedness, and the want of compassion, and ambition
Hast thou never heard that 'love covereth a multitude of sins'?
And this is what your Father which is in heaven doeth for you. If ye do not forgive each other in your hearts, your Father which is in heaven will not forgive you your sins.
Behold ye know, O my beloved, that we have clothed ourselves with the good and man-loving Christ.
Let us not strip ourselves naked of Him for the sake of our evil works; for we are vowed to God in purity, and we are vowed to the life of the monk.
Let us do the works thereof which are these: fasting and praying without ceasing, and purity of the body and purity of the heart.
Since we have vowed ourselves to God in purity let us not associate ourselves with the fornications which take manifold forms,
for He saith, 'They committed fornication in very many ways.'
O my brethren, o let us not permit ourselves to be found in the works which are of the kind which will make us to fall below every (other) man.
Moreover, we have promised to become disciples of Christ;
let us therefore afflict ourselves, for sorrow bringeth low impurity.
And now that the contest is set, let us not allow ourselves to be defeated, so that we may not become slaves unto sin.
Lightgivers have been placed in the world for us, let them not be offended because of us, let us bear silently,
for very many shall be saved through our sobriety, O brethren.
Let us not enter into reckoning with each other, in order that they may not enter into reckoning with us in the hour of punishment, whether ye are virgins, or whether ye are set apart to do special work, or whether ye are anchorites.
Assuredly He shall say unto us, Bring (it hither), this belongeth to Me, and the increase thereof.' And He shall chide us, and say unto us, ' Where is the apparel of the bridal chamber?
'If thou dost not make peace with thy brother in this world,
I will not be with thee in the Day of the Great Judgement.
(If) thou despisest the poor man, it is I Whom thou despisest therewith.
(If) thou rejectest the man of misery, thou art the fellow (or, companion) of the man who rejected Me in My humility upon the Cross.
Did I ever demand from thee anything during My absence from My home in the world?
Did I not bestow upon thee My Body and My Blood, the Good of life?
Did I not taste the death for thy sake until I redeemed thee?
Did I not make thee acquainted with the mystery of heaven, and make thee My brother and companion?
Did I not give unto thee the power to trample under thy feet vipers and scorpions, and all the might of the Enemy?
Did I not give unto thee manifold medicines of life wherewith thou mightest heal thyself?
My powers, and My signs, and My miracles, which I bore in the world as the [ armour of soldierhood I gave unto thee that thou mightest gird thyself about therewith, and mightest cast down head-long Goliath, that is to say the Devil.
Now therefore, O my son, these things and those which are far more severe shall we hear if we continue to be careless, and are not obedient (to the command) to forgive one another.
Let us be sober.
We know the virtues of God which shall help us in the day of death, and which shall act as a guide for us in the midst of the cruel and terrifying war, and which shall raise up (our) soul(s) from the dead.
Now first of all there have been given unto us faith and the knowledge whereby we may expel unbelief from within us.
Next, there have been given unto us wisdom and understanding which enable us to understand the thoughts of the Devil, and to flee from him, and to hate him.
(And) there are preached unto us fasting, and prayer, and continence, which shall give peace and tranquillity in the body (which is vexed) by passion.
There have been given unto us purity and abstinence through which God shall dwell in us.
And there have been given unto us patient endurance and long-suffering, and if we keep carefully all these (virtues) we shall inherit the glory of God.
There have been given unto us love and peace, these mighty warriors in the battle, for the Enemy is unable to draw nigh unto the place wherein these are.
We have been commanded concerning the joy wherein there is no grief if we fight.
And we have also been instructed in generosity and in Christlikeness.
There have been given unto us holy prayer and long-suffering, which are wont to fill the soul with light.
There have been given unto us innocency of heart and simplicity, which are wont to blot out wickedness.
Directions have been written down for us in respect of judging no man, and we must overcome the falsehood of this evil blemish which is in man
for if we do not judge they will not judge us in the Day of Judgement.
For the pleasure which attendeth drinking in excess maketh a man of understanding- to become a fool, and it turneth the conscience into a shameless thing, and it setteth loose the bridle of the tongue.
The greatest joy in all the world is to sorrow in the Holy Spirit; let us not stray in pleasure.
For the priest spake, and the prophet gave a warning concerning wine,
'Wine is insolent, drunkenness is a disgrace; whosoever shall devote himself to these shall not be innocent of sin'
Wine is good if we drink it in moderation ; if thou givest thine eye to the wine-bottles and to the drinking-pots, thou shalt go naked, even like a corn-stalk (?).
Therefore let all those who have prepared themselves to be disciples of Jesus keep themselves away from wine and from drunkenness.
For our fathers knew very well the danger which would arise because of wine, and they abstained from it, for they were wont to drink it in very small quantities when suffering from sickness.
Now if only a very little wine was allowed to be given to the mighty workman Timothy, whose body was in a very infirm condition, then what shall I say in respect of the man who is bubbling over with wickedness, and is in the prime of early manhood, and who hath in him impure desires and passion in abundance?
I am afraid to say it: Let no man drink wine at all, so that he may not hate his own salvation (and) murmur against me.
For these words will be hard unto many at (this) time.
Nevertheless, my beloved, it is good to keep oneself (from wine), and soberness (?) is beneficial ; for he who keepeth himself sober (?) shall sail in safety his ship into the harbour of the salvation, which is good and holy, and he shall drink of the good things of heaven.
And again, a greater thing than all these hath been given into thine hand, namely, the humility which keepeth watch over all the virtues ; humility was this great and holy power wherein God arrayed Himself when He came into the world.
It is the wall (round about) the virtues, the treasure-house of actions (or, deeds), the armour which delivereth, the healer of every grief.
And when the apparel of byssus had been made, and the vessels of gold for the tabernacle, and all the things for adornment, they put on apparel of sackcloth.
(Humility) is one of the least of things in the sight of men, but it is chosen and most honourable before God.
If we acquire it for ourselves we shall (be able to) tread upon all the power of the Enemy.
For He said, 'On whom shall I look except upon him that is humble and long-suffering?'
Let us not relax our attention in the time of hunger, for boasting increaseth in a man as well as prudence.
When gluttony increaseth, fornication reigneth through the drinking of the body, (and) pride hath rule, and the novices cease to listen to the elders, and the elders cease to trouble in any way about the novices, and each one walketh according to the desire of his own heart.
This is the time wherein we must cry out with the prophet, 'Woe unto me, O my soul, for he who striketh terror destroyeth upon the earth.
And he who is upright among men existeth not according to the Christ, that is to say he doth not exist at all, and each one afflicteth his neighbour.'
Strive ye, O my beloved, for the time hath drawn nigh, and the days have diminished. The father no longer giveth instruction to his son, and the son hearkeneth not to his father.
The good Virgins have come to an end. The holy fathers are asleep in every place, the mothers are destroyed like the widows, we have become like unto orphans.
Let us fight for ourselves, inasmuch as repentance is sufficient for us.
Let us put on ourselves sorrow, and make ourselves new (creatures) in humility.
Let us become lovers of men, and make ourselves companions of Christ, the Lover of mankind.
Since we are vowed unto God, (we must lead) the life of the monk in love.
Virginity doth not (mean) virginity of the body only, but the keeping of oneself from every sin.
For in the Gospel certain virgins were rejected because of their careless slothfulness, whilst those who watched bravely went into the chamber of the bridegroom.
May it happen then that every one (here) may enter into that place for ever!
And as concerning the love of money by means of which fighting is carried on against us.
If thou wishest to gain for thyself these things (or, possessions) which are transient, and can be destroyed by fire, by great avariciousness, or by trafficking, or by violence, or by evil design, or by excessive manual labour, thou art not free to serve God, at least certainly not in every way.
If thou hast the eager desire to collect for thyself gold or bronze, remember that which He spake in the Gospel, saying, 'Thou man of no understanding, they shall carry away thy soul this very night; (and) the things which thou hast prepared unto whom shall they belong?
Strive eagerly then, O my beloved, and fight against (this) passion.
Thou shalt say, 'I will do what Abraham did, I will act uprightly in respect of God, the Most High, Who created the heavens and the earth—saying. If I have taken anything of the things which belong unto thee, from a thread even unto a shoe-latchet'
The stranger who is humble is a great good, and the Lord loveth the proselyte. Concerning, moreover, the slothfulness by means of which fighting is carried on against us, (and) concerning the right hand of need,
remember that it is written, 'Thy houses for gathering in are accursed, and the things which are in them.'
And again concerning the gold and the bronze James spake, saying, 'Their rust shall bear witness against them, and the rust shall devour your flesh like fire.'
And, 'He chose a man, a righteous man who had no idol, he saw their affliction'
Again, purify thyself from the curse before the Lord calleth thee, for thou hast set thy hope upon God, because it is written 'Let your hearts be purified, (and) perfect towards God.'
I enquire of thee, O my beloved in the Lord,
for if thou hast made God to be a helper (unto thee), and if thou art unto Him one beloved, and if thou hast set thy heart to walk in the commandments of God,
then will God Himself bless thee so greatly that thy fountain shall become a river unto thee, and thy river shall become unto thee a sea.
For thou art the chariot, and continence shall be the charioteer. The lamp of God is kindled above thee, and thou shalt give forth the light which belongeth unto the Spirit.
Thou shalt control thy words in (giving) judgement.
God granteth unto thee graciously the skill of the saints in contending, so that thou mayest not fall headlong before the image (or, phantom) in thy city.
Thou settest thy foot upon the neck of the prince of darkness.
And besides these things, I command thee not to relax thy hold upon thy heart, for it is the joy of devils to make a man to relax his hold upon his heart, and to bring him into the net before he is aware of it.
Therefore be not thou careless in receiving the teaching of the fear of the Lord.
Thou shalt go forward (or, grow) like the new plants,
and thou shalt please God like a new (i. e. young) bull which driveth away the sheep with (his) horns.
Moreover, be thou a valiant man, both in deed and in word.
Do not turn thy face away as do the hypocrites, lest thou join them and become converted unto them.
Do not destroy (or, waste) the first day (of the week) in thy field, for thou must know what that must give to God day by day.
Seat thyself by thyself, like a prudent governor, and try (thyself) judicially according to thy reason; and whether thou art away by qf thyself on a journey, or whether thou art among a crowd,
thou shall pass judgement on thyself daily.
For it is very much better for thee to be one among a crowd of a thousand people and to possess a very little humility, than to be a man living in the cave of a hyena in pride.
It may be remembered in respect of Lot, that he lived in the midst of Sodom, and still was a believer and a good man.
But we also hear in respect of Cain, with whom upon the earth there were only three other people, that he became a sinner.
Now therefore, behold, the contest is prepared for thee. Examine thou carefully those who come upon thee daily, for we must hide ourselves even as those who wage war against us hide themselves.
For the devils are not wont to come against thee on the right hand only, but they appear also on the left hand to every man.
For in very truth, in my own case, they fought against me on the right-hand side, and they brought unto me the Devil, being bound in the form of a wild ass, but the Lord helped me.
Now, therefore, O my son, array thyself in humility, and make the Christ to be unto thee a counsellor, and His Good Father (also);
make thyself a companion and a divine man, in whose heart is the Law of God.
Make thyself to be like unto the poor man who carried His Cross, who became a companion of weeping.
Make thyself to become poor, (put) a napkin on thy head, and let thy place of abode be unto thee a tomb, until God shall raise thee up and give unto thee the crown of triumph.
If it happeneth on a time that thou art utterly cast down about a brother, who hath caused thee suffering by (his) words ;
or if thy heart hath been wounded by a brother, and thou sayest, 'he is not worth this ';
Remember how that thou thyself hast benefited on several occasions.
Dost thou not hear the Christ saying, 'Forgive thy brother seventy times seven'?
Dost thou thyself not weep often when thou makest supplication, saying, 'Forgive me I the multitude of my sins '?
And straightway thou shalt rise up, and thou shalt be [feeling] the consolation of repentance,
thou shalt flee to the feet of thy brother,
thy heart shall be as water,
thy face shall be joyful, thy mouth shall be filled with gladness,
peace shall be enveloping thee, and thou shalt make supplication to thy brother,
Thy weeping shall be abundant, but great joy shall be unto thee through (thy) tears.
And peace shall boast itself in your midst, and the Spirit of God Himself shall rejoice and shall cry out, saying, 'Blessed are the peacemakers, for it is they who shall be called the sons of God.'
When the Enemy heareth the sound of the voice (of thy weeping) he becometh ashamed.
(Take care) that God is glorified, so that a great blessing may be unto thee.
Now therefore, O my brother, let us fight boldly. Thou knowest that contention existeth in every place.
The churches are filled with men who love fighting and with men of wrath.
The Congregations and the bodies of monks love to arrogate to themselves greatness, pride hath made itself to be king (or, to rule).
No man sheweth bravery on behalf of his neighbour, but every man inflicteth persecution on his neighbour.
We have fallen into the midst of sufferings.
There is neither prophet nor Gnostic.
No man chideth another in respect of any matter, because hardness of heart hath increased.
He who hath understanding shall speak out, for the time is evil.
Every man maketh himself to be his own king, and they devote their minds to the contemplation of the things which are unseemly.
Through the diligence and the care of our God-loving brother, Xael, the son of the blessed Stephanos, the rush of lions on the man of the plains, belonging to the heart of the city, Esna.
He composed this book through his labor.
He presented it to the monastery of the Holy Macarius of the mountain of the city, Tbow, for the salvation of his soul in order for them to read in it the name of the Holy John, and the Holy Apa Pahmon so that the Holy Macarius, the soldier and courageous martyr and the Holy John the Baptist, the forerunner of Christ and the Holy Apa Pahmon, the Archimandrite will intercede to Christ for him.
and that he blesses him in this world and that he preserves him from every snare of the Devil and wicked men and he assists him in every good thing after the circumstance of this life so he will be worthy of the forgiveness of his sins and receive the inheritance of all the saints, as it shall come to pass. Amen.
Remember, for my part, Theopistis, of the deacon, the son of Severus, the archpriest of the Holy Macarius of the City Esna.
 I wrote this work by my hand. Pray for me so that God forgives the multitude of my sins because they cry out exceedingly.
[HERE BEGINNETH] THE MARTYRDOM OF SAINT BIKTÔR (VICTOR), THE GENERAL AND MARTYR, THE MAN GLORIOUS IN CHRIST, THE WEARER OF THE CROWN IN VERY TRUTH, WHO COMPLETED HIS GLORIOUS STRIFE ON THE SEVEN AND TWENTIETH DAY OF THE MONTH PHARMOUTE.
IN THE PEACE OF GOD. MAY HIS HOLY BLESSING COME UPON US, AND MAY WE ALL BE SAVED TOGETHER. AMEN.
And it came to pass in the kingdom (i. e. reign) of the Emperor Diocletian in the third year of his reign, in the first month, that the Devil led his heart astray from God, and made him to do the things that were not seemly.
And Diocletian worshipped idols, and thrust the God of heaven behind his back, for the sake of [creatures made of] wood and stones, and for the sake of the vain things that were fashioned by the hands of men.
Hearken [ye] now to [the account of] the valour of the young man [called] Victor.
And the Emperor Diocletian took counsel and decided to do the things that were unseemly before God, Jesus the Christ; and this is what he did.
He made seventy images of gold, and gave unto them the name of gods which they certainly were not.
To thirty-five of these he gave names of gods, and to thirty-five the names of goddesses;
now the number of his other gods and goddesses amounted to one hundred and forty.
And it came to pass at dawn, on the first day of the month Parmoute, that the Emperor Diocletian, and all his army, and the eparchs, and the generals went into the temple.
And the Emperor took his seat upon the throne, and he caused the herald to make a proclamation, saying,
O [all] ye Roman people, come ye and offer up sacrifice.'
And the Emperor made an altar of silver and a vessel wherein to burn incense of gold ;
and he made a great pedestal of gold,
and he placed it before the altar so that the [statue of] Apollo might be set upon it.
And the Emperor commanded them to bring frankincense, and the finest flour of wheat, and the purest oil, and rare old wine, and to pour them out upon the altar whereon was blazing fire.
And afterwards they lighted two hundred candles on golden candlesticks, and four hundred candles on silver candlesticks, and two hundred white horses drew his gods into the temple.
'And when they had brought his gods into the temple the Emperor Diocletian stood up on his throne,
and he lifted his crown off his head, and set it upon the head of [the statue of] Apollo, and he bowed down and worshipped it three times, saying,
Thou art the god who livest, O Apollo, the greatest of the gods, who dost give unto us victory in war.
And after the Emperor had worshipped Apollo, his three fellow [Caesars], Romanus, Basileides, and Euaios, came and worshipped Apollo also.
Now these | held equal rank and power with the Fol. 2 « Emperor, and he loved them exceedingly.
And it came to pass that when the turn of the Protector had come to offer up sacrifice, now his name was Basileides
And it came to pass that when all the people had offered up sacrifice it came to the turn of his son to offer up sacrifice.
Now he was a young man of nineteen years of age, and he worshipped God, and held His commandments in fear.
He was a virgin in body, he ate once only each week, he prayed all night long,
and from the day wherein he had heard the Christians crying out to him in the church his heart had departed into heaven.
He hated the world. He did not drink wine, neither did he eat food cooked with fire.
He did not decorate his person, and he did not adorn himself with rich apparel and fine raiment.
He did not mount the horse which was used in a chariot (i. e. a war-horse).
He neither ate food with his father nor did he enter into converse with him in the presence of any one who was greater than himself.
He never gave utterance to an obscene (or, scurrilous) word,
and never, under any circumstances, did he swear an oath by anything or by anybody.
And whenever he heard concerning any one who was in distress, if that person w^ere a Christian, ^ he used to minister unto him,
And his father wearied him exceedingly, saying, 'I shall take the daughter of Basileides the general for thee to wife,'
for his father and Basileides had made an agreement in respect of her for two hundred centenarii of gold, besides gifts, and four hundred centenarii of silver,
and ten menservants, and ten hundred maidservants wearing golden bracelets, and four hundred horses, and ten hundred mules, and ten hundred camels, and ten hundred farms which were under tillage,
and ten hundred ships which sailed the sea, and ten houses (palaces ?) to [each] one of which were attached ten farms under tillage,
besides the things which his father was to give to him, and a very large number of men who were to do the work on [his] land.
And the blessed Apa Victor would not be persuaded by his father and Basileides, and he said unto them,
' All these things shall perish ' ;
and he kept himself for the kingdom that is in the heavens.
And the Lord Jesus was wont to appear to him, face to face, and He loved him because of his purity.
And the noble Victor made for himself a small chamber in his house, I and there he would retire to be free from the company of his parents.
HERE BEGINNETH THE LIFE OF THE BLESSED JOHN, THE PERFECT MONK, WHOSE PARENTS MADE FOR HIM A GOSPEL OF GOLD
AND WHO ENDED HIS LIFE, WITH THE MOST EXCELLENT PATIENT ENDURANCE, ON THE FOURTH DAY OF THE MONTH MEKHIR, IN THE PEACE OF GOD. PRAY FOR US ALL! AMEN.
This life which I will now describe unto you is that of a man of God, who lived in our time, and it must be regarded with wonder.
And they had three children.
Now two of these had been appointed to high positions in the Palace of the Emperors,
and the youngest had been sent to receive instruction in the works of God.
And after these things he learned the teachings of the wise men, and associated with them.
Moreover he learned the works of God, and attached himself to the church, making enquiries concerning God by day and by night.
And this monk spake unto John inside his house with the words of God,
and John marvelled exceedingly when he saw the monkish brother, and his garb, and perceived his pleasant manner of speech, and his internal thought about God, which was like fire.
The monkish brother said unto him, 'I live in the Monastery of the Sleepless Ones.'
And if God pleaseth I wish to go to Jerusalem so that I may pray there in the Holy Place, and, by the will of God, I will return again to my place.
And the monk informed him concerning everything about which John enquired of him.
And when John had heard these words he laid hold upon the hand of the monkish brother, and took him to a place which was quiet and secret,
and he made him to swear great oaths, saying unto him, 'My beloved brother, when thou hast gone to Jerusalem, and hast returned in peace, thou shalt not hide thyself from me,
neither shalt thou depart to thy monastery and forsake me, and I will not hide anything from thee during the whole course of my life. My parents, however, love me very much more than they love my brethren,
for they have placed me in the hands of instructors,
and my father saith, 'I will give thee high offices.'
Moreover, according to what is in his heart, he wisheth to give me seven offices, each of which is more exalted than his own.
After these things he wisheth to make me a bridegroom.
And, moreover, when I go into the church I hear them proclaiming and saying, 'Everything in this world is contemptible,' and 'Let him that despiseth this world follow the Christ with a right heart,' and even so he shall hardly be saved.
And after these things the blessed John took counsel with himself, saying, 'First of all let me go to my parents, so that i may make them prepare for me a Gospel wherein I may read, for I do not know the commandments of Christ,
and I would find Him in the place whither I am going.'
And he came to the house of his parents,
and he told them the reason [for his desire], and he spake unto them thus: 'Behold, O my parents, I am put to shame among my fellow scholars, for of all those who are at school with me each one hath his own Gospel of gold, which their parents have prepared for them to read in.
As for me I am like a beggar in their midst, and like one who hath neither father nor mother.'
And when his mother heard [these words] she rejoiced exceedingly, for it was her wish that he should be well instructed.
And when she had thought over these things she spake unto her husband, saying, 'My lord brother, make a Gospel of gold for our son John.
Do not have it beautifully written only, but decorate it also beautifully with really precious stones of great value.'
And straightway his father commanded,
and one brought to him five hundred holokottinoi (oboli) and precious stones of great beauty, and he gave them to a cunning goldsmith,
and he made for him very beautiful decorations for the Gospel which he had caused to be written.
And John's father took it and gave it to his son,
and John took it, and rejoiced over it,
and he studied it with great diligence.
And he waited for that brother who was a monk to come in order to depart with him;
And when John saw the brother who was a monk he rejoiced exceedingly, and was glad, and he saluted him, and he was in a state of great joy.
And he said unto him, 'My lord father, I know the wishes of my parents, and their love towards me,
and especially the wish and love of my mother. If she were to hear of such a thing as this in connection with me she would weep, and suffer greatly because of me.
I therefore beseech thee to let us arrange that we go away secretly,
and not to let any one know of our departure.'
And the monk said unto him, 'Whatsoever pleaseth thee that will I do with thee,
And John and the monk rose up,
and they departed secretly.
And they arrived at the sea, and they searched for a boat wherein to embark.
Then John said unto him, 'I will give them to thee';
and when John had said this he came to the place where was the brother who was a monk,
and he said unto him, 'My father, the ship's fare is large, and it is meet for thee that we should depart quickly, lest some people meet us, and they recognize us, and they seize us, and we be put to shame. Therefore, let us flee secretly.'
Then John went into his house to his mother,
and he said unto her, 'I make entreaty unto thee, O my beloved mother. I know well that thou fulfillest all my wishes,
but there is one thing that I lack, [and which if granted] would cause us both to be praised.'
And she said unto him, 'Whatsoever thou wishest ask at my hand, my son, and I will fulfill thy desire for thee.'
And John said unto his mother, 'Thou knowest that all the youths who are with me at school have provided me with meals, and that not once, nor twice, and that I have eaten often of their provisions.
Now there is nothing at all which I can do for them in return for what they have given unto me,
and I am in truth ashamed to enter the school again because of this matter.'
His mother saith unto him, 'Whatsoever thou wishest I will do for thee.
When thy father cometh into the house at the hour of noon I will make him to give it (i.e., money) to thee, so that thou and thy companions mayest do what thou wishest therewith.'
And his father answered and said, 'I will give unto him everything that he wisheth for,
and appointed a servant to attend him.
And when John had taken the money he went to the place wherein was the monk, both he and the servant who accompanied him, and he said unto the monk, 'My lord brother, this servant whom thou seest belongeth to me.
I beseech thee to do me an act of grace, and let him tarry with thee, whilst I go to the place where some neighbours of mine are to enquire concerning a certain person who was coming to me at this hour.'
Then the old man, the monk, understood that he was talking to him concerning the captain of the ship,
and that he wished to go away by himself by reason of the servant who accompanied him.
And John took the hundred oboli, and came to the place of the captain of the ship,
I beseech thee, O my lord brother, to make ready to sail, and let us depart quickly, I and my brother.'
And when the captain heard this, [and knew] that he wished to depart secretly, he said unto him, 'I have already finished making my ship ready to sail, and I have already told you that the passage money by my ship is high.
However, if thou wilt remain in this place until I have loaded up my vessel, I will embark thee.'
And John said, 'I have already told thee that I will give thee the passage money, according to what thou didst say.'
And straightway he brought out the hundred oboli in his hand, rejoicing greatly,
and he gave them to him, saying, 'Whatsoever thou informest me [is needed] more than these I will give unto thee.
And when the captain of the ship heard these words he took the hundred oboli in his hand, and rejoiced exceedingly,
and he said unto John, 'Go and bring thy companion, and come [back];
if it be the will of God I will take most excellent care of you.'
And John returned,
and informed the brother who was a monk about everything that had happened unto him.
And after two days John said unto the monk, 'Rise up, and let us depart by sea, because this is the day whereon I ought to make ready the meal for my fellow learners,
and I ought to seek for some small fish for them.'
And they came to the sea-shore by the will of God,
and a favorable wind arose,
and the captain embarked on the ship, and stood on the side of it,
and he stooped down and beckoned to John and the monk, saying, 'Arise come ye and embark.'
Now they were troubled, for they wished to send away the servant from them, and to leave him behind,
but they could not find any satisfactory means for doing so.
And John said unto the servant who was accompanying him, 'Rise up and go to the palace, to the scholars, and see if they have all assembled there, and then come back quickly and let me know;
behold, I will wait for thee here';
and the servant departed.
And they themselves went up into the ship, which set sail at once,
and they arrived at the monastery by the will of God.
And the servant returned to the sea-shore and did not find them,
and he was disturbed exceedingly in his mind, saying, 'Shall I take to flight and not tell my master?'
Then he said, 'I am afraid that they will make search for me and that they will find me, and inflict many evils upon me;
And it came to pass that when his mother heard these things she rent her garments,
and she scattered dust upon her head,
and she wept with a great weeping, saying, 'Woe is me, O my beloved son John!
What hath become of thee, O my sweet son? Woe is me, O my son! For thy face is . . . . . . . . . O John, my beloved son!
Woe is me!
Who hath carried away the light of my body?
I know not.
Woe is me!
Who hath carried away my beloved son, the darling of my soul?
O John, my beloved son!
O light of mine eyes!
Why did I send thee forth after wisdom in this manner [to meet] the fate which hath come upon thee?
Woe be unto me, o my son, who was sweet to everyone!
Woe be unto me, my son, my sweet one, thou face full of joy!
Woe unto me, thou who resemblest the angels!
Woe unto me! What shall I do from this day henceforth?'
And thus also did his father weep, with groanings, and sighings, and sorrow of heart, and he cried out, saying, What hath happened unto thee, O my beloved son?
I know not what hath happened unto thee suddenly.'
And whilst the seven days of weeping were being fulfilled the whole city mourned with them.
Then his father rose up and went into the palace, and informed the king of everything which had happened,
and he entreated him to send out an order to every part of his kingdom, so that the people might seek for his son, and, peradventure, might find him.
And [although] his parents have worn themselves out in going round about without finding him they ascribed glory to God.
And John came to the monastery, he and the monk also who accompanied him,
and he carried with him the Gospel of gold which his parents had made for him,
and he (i.e., the monk) informed the head of the monastery of everything which had happened to the young man John, and about his great belief in God.
And the Archimandrite said unto the young man, 'My son, behold, I see that thou art young in years, but exceedingly well-doing in thy works.
Moreover, my son, every one who wisheth to withdraw himself from this world, if he be of thine age, waiteth patiently for forty days, and after that period the hair of his head is shaved off, and then he assumeth the garb of the monk.'
And John said unto him, 'I adjure thee, O my holy father, by the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, and by the prayers of the monastery, that thou shave my head this day, and especially, as God knoweth, my heart burneth with desire for the life of the monk, and for the garb of the angels.'
And the Archimandrite was persuaded, and straightway he prayed over him, and he placed upon him the angelic garb.
And the heart of John rejoiced within him exceedingly, and he prayed to God by day and by night with such exceedingly long prayers that his praying, and his daily contest, and his asceticism were far in excess of a very great many of those who were his neighbours.
and besides this he engaged in many contests of self-abnegation, and practised many habits of self-repression.
And the Archimandrite saw him, and marvelled exceedingly.
And the Archimandrite said unto him, 'My son, thou art a very young man, but behold, I see thee practising very many mighty works of abstinence; thou wilt thyself destroy thine own body, and wilt not be able to stand up, neither to pray, nor to fast.
For overmuch ascetic labour exhausteth a man greatly, and maketh him weak.'
But John did not cease to practise the labours which he had begun to perform.
I rose up and I followed him.
I walked through the Paradise, and I looked round about, and I saw the tree in the middle of Paradise;
now it had no fruit upon it, and thorns grew all over it, and the trunk went down into the ground a very long way.
And I answered and said to the Cherubim, 'Make me to understand the matter of this tree which hath no fruit on it,
and which is grown over with thorns.'
And the Cherubim said unto me, 'This is the tree [of the fruit] of which Adam ate and became naked.'
And I said unto him, 'There is no fruit on it;
where did he find the fruit which he ate?'
And he said unto me, 'A kind of fruit did grow on it, and it was not without fruit [at that time].'
And I said unto him, 'Of what kind was its fruit?'
He said unto me, 'It was a kind of apple.'
And I said unto the Cherubim, 'Shall it remain wholly without fruit, or not?'
And he said unto me, 'This is the order which God laid upon it from the beginning.'
Now whilst I was marvelling at these things I saw Adam.
He was coming along at a distance, and he was like unto a man who was weeping.
He was spreading out his garment, and he was carrying away in his garment [the leaves] which were under the tree, and pouring them out on the ground, and burying them.
Then the Cherubim said unto me, 'Four and twenty angels are appointed to Paradise daily,
and twelve go in there daily to worship God.
Now at the moment when the Devil went into Paradise, and seduced Adam, there was no angel at all in Paradise,
but an agreement took place [that they should remain outside it] until Adam had eaten of the tree.'
And I said to him, 'If they agreed to this, with the consent of God, then no sin rests upon Adam.' And the Cherubim said unto me, 'By no means. If Adam had been patient for a short time, God would have said to him, 'Eat thou of the tree.'
God removed the righteousness wherewith he was arrayed, and He cast him forth from Paradise, in order that the things which He spake might be fulfilled [when] He should send His Son into the world.'
And I said unto him, 'My Lord, of what kind was this righteousness wherein Adam was arrayed, and which he received from His hand?'
And he said unto me, 'On the day wherein God created Adam, he was twelve cubits in height,
and six cubits in width,
and, again, I have heard that God brought a deep sleep upon Adam, and that when he was unconscious, He took one of the ribs from his side,
and made it into a woman, and that He filled up the place where the rib was in his side with flesh.
The Almighty did not then create two bodies,
there being [only] one body.'
And he answered and he said unto me, 'Hearken, and I will explain unto you everything.
At the time when God created Adam, He created Eve also with him, in one body,
for at the time when the Master was working at Adam, the thought concerning Eve was with Him.
For this reason two bodies came from one body,
but He did not separate them from each other immediately.
At the time when He brought slumber upon him, and he fell asleep,
and he slept heavily, He brought Eve forth from him, and she became his wife. She was, of a surety, hidden in the rib of the left side [of Adam] from the day wherein God created him.
Consider then, with great attention the sign which is in the sons of Adam.'
And I said unto him, 'O my Lord,
what is the sign which is in the sons of Adam?'
'And the Cherubim said unto me, 'At the moment when the ice (or, cold) was about to come upon the earth, the first things which went cold in the body of the man were his finger nails.
Because at the time when God deprived Adam of the righteousness wherein he was arrayed,
And any man who was attacked by a sickness [or, disease], no matter of what kind, used to go into the temple, and look upon the wall, until he found there written the remedy which was suitable for his sickness;
then he would take that remedy, and would go into his house, ascribing glory to God.
And it came to pass that, after Solomon the king was dead, Hezekiah plastered over the walls of the temple with lime, and the prescriptions for the relief of sickness could no longer be found.
Now when Hezekiah the king had fallen sick, and was sick unto death, he could not find the prescription whereby to heal his sickness,
because it was he himself who had plastered over the walls of the temple with lime.
And when the prescriptions which had been written upon them could not be found again, he went into the house of the Lord,
and lay down there, and he looked upon the wall, and he wept,
saying, 'My Lord, let not that which I have done in the matter of plastering over with lime the walls, whereon were inscribed the prescriptions for healing, be held to be a sin [by Thee], for I said, Let men make supplication to God with hope, and they shall find healing.
Never shall I find a prescription for healing whereby I may be made whole.'
And the Lord heard [him], and had compassion upon him, and sent unto him Isaiah the Prophet, and he spake unto him, saying, 'Take the fruit(?) of the wild fig-tree, and plaster it over thy body, and thou shalt find relief.'
And again I said unto the Cherubim,
My Lord, I would that thou didst make me to understand the matter of the Cherubim, whose voices cry so loudly
in heaven that mankind tremble upon earth (at the sounds thereof).'
And the Cherubim said unto me, Dost thou see these great winds which are shut up inside their storehouses, over which the angels are set?
When the trumpet soundeth inside the covering (or, veil), the gentle winds come forth, and they breathe upon the wings of the angel who is over the fountain of the dew; then the angel moveth his wings, and the dew cometh upon the earth, and the seed (or, grain) groweth in the earth,
and the trees, and the crops, and the fruit.
If the trumpet doth not sound, a harsh, strong noise cometh forth from heaven, and thereupon the waters of rain come upon the earth in great quantities, which make the fruits grow, and rain-storms,
and thunders of which men are afraid.
For it is the sound of the rustling of the wings of the Seraphim which governs the waters of rain,
until they come down into the firmament; and they fall on the earth gently,
for if they were to descend upon the earth in their (full) violence they would lay waste the earth just as did the waters of Noah and the lightnings which came with them.
(This would happen) if the Seraphim did not come down to govern the waters of the rain, for all the waters are in the sky and the heavens.
Behold, I have made clear to you all mysteries.'
And I answered and said unto the Cherubim, 'My Lord, I would that thou didst make me to know what it is which supporteth the sky
and maketh it to be suspendeth thus.'
And he said unto me, 'It is suspended by faith, and by the ordinance of God.'
And I said unto him, 'What is it that supporteth the earth?'
And he said unto me, 'It is four pillars which support the earth, and they are sealed with seven seals.'
And I said unto him, 'My Lord, be not wroth with me
when I ask thee this matter also;
He said unto me, 'Hearken, I will shew thee.
God appointed twelve Cherubim to stand outside the curtain (or, inner veil) and they were not to toil in any way, but were to sing twelve hymns daily.
When the first Cherubim had finished (singing) his hymn, the first hour came to an end.
When the second Cherubim had finished (singing) his hymn, the second hour came to an end, and so on until the twelfth Cherubim.
When the twelfth (Cherubim had finished singing his hymn), the twelve hours were ended.'
I said to him, 'As concerning the twelve hours of the night: are there Seraphim appointed over them, or not?'
And he said unto me, 'Assuredly not, but when the beasts, and the birds, and the reptiles
pray, the first hour is ended.
When the second hour is ended, the beasts pray (again), and so on until the twelfth hour of the night;
it is the animals of God which set limits to them.'
And I said unto the Cherubim, 'Doth the sun know when the twelve hours have come to an end,
so that he may depart to the place where he setteth or riseth?'
And he said unto me, 'When the angels who blow the trumpets have finished, Michael knoweth that the twelfth hymn is finished, and he speaketh to the Angel of the Sun, who goeth and bringeth an end to his course.'
And I answered and said unto the Cherubim, 'My Lord, is it God Who ordaineth the life of a man from the time when he was in his mother's womb, or not?'
And he said unto me, 'Know thou that (one) man is wont to perform very many superfluous works, (and another) very many acts of goodness, from the time when he is born to the end of his life.
And I said unto the Cherubim, 'Man hath been born to suffering,
according to what Job said, 'My mother brought me forth for suffering.'
And he said unto me, 'God is a compassionate Being,
and He doth not forsake man utterly,
but He sheweth mercy upon him, for he is His own form, and His own image,
and the work of His own hands.
And now, O John, He will not forsake him that doeth the will of God, and he who doeth good things shall receive them doubled many times over in the House of God.'
And I said unto the Cherubim, 'My Lord, at the moment when God is about to create man, doth He give him the name 'righteous' or 'sinner,' or not?'
And he said unto me, 'Hearken, and I will shew thee.
At the moment when God is about to create a man, before He placeth him
in the womb of his mother, He calleth all the angels, and they come and stand round about.
If the Father blesseth the soul, the angels make answer 'Amen.'
If there come from His mouth the words 'This soul shall give Me rest,' the angels make answer, 'Amen.'
If the Father saith, 'This soul shall commit iniquity,'
the angels make answer, 'Amen.'
Whatsoever cometh forth from the mouth of the Father, that cometh to pass.'
And I said unto him, 'Is the matter of which man is fashioned more excellent than that of the beasts?'
He said unto me, 'Now when men die, each one of them is taken
to the place of which he is worthy,
but so far as beasts are concerned, whether they die,
And I said unto him, 'Are there souls in them?'
He said unto me, 'Every created thing hath a soul in it.'
Now, therefore, the soul of every created thing is its blood.'
And I said unto him, 'Will they then be punished,
or will rest be given unto them?'
He said unto me, 'Let it not be that rest be not given unto them, and let them suffer not;
but man is a being who can suffer, and can enjoy rest.' And it came to pass that when I had heard all these things, I marvelled at the works which God performeth in connexion with man.
And I said unto him, 'Be not wroth with me if I ask this matter.
I would that thou didst inform me concerning the stars which we see in the firmament, and tell me why it is that we cease to see them when the sun hath risen.
I would that thou didst inform me where it is they go until it is time for them to perform their service.' And he said unto me, 'The stars are of different orders.
There are some stars which remain in the heavens until noon,
but they cannot be seen because of the light of the sun.
There are seven stars which come in the north of the world, and they remain there in the heavens always.
And there are seven stars in the heavens which are called 'the gods'; those which are there are not permitted
to emerge from their place of storehouse,
except when death cometh upon the earth.'
And I said unto him, 'Why is it that one star differeth from another?
And why is it that a star is wont to transfer itself from the place which it had originally (to another)?'
And the Cherubim said unto me, 'Hearken, and I will make known unto you everything.
There are very many orders of stars which move from the place wherein they were placed originally,
but the decree of God which directeth them abideth forever.
Behold now, I have made manifest unto thee all things, O beloved one of God. Arise, get thee down into the world, and tell therein everything which thou hast seen.'
Then straightway he brought me down on the Mount of Olives, where I found the Apostles gathered together. And I told them of the things which I had seen, and when we had saluted (or, kissed) each other, each departed to his country, ascribing glory to God.
And Apa Victor looked closely at the man, and he knew of a certainty that he was a phantom, and he; said unto him
Get thee gone from me. It is through thee that the whole world is in a state of disruption, and it is through thee that the worship of idols flourisheth.'
And the blessed man Apa Victor turned his face towards the east, and said
Shew Thy compassion upon me, O Thou only Son of Thy Father, my Lord Jesus the Christ, and deliver out of all my tribulations
And when the Devil heard the Name of Jesus, straightway he made himself visible.
And Apa Victor continued to live in the Camp, and Jesus was with him in everything which he did.
And the noble man Victor meditated within himself and said, 'What kind of work can I do whereby I may live?'
Now he had learned the trade of an artisan, and whilst he was living by himself in the Camp he used to make seats and lamp-stands.
And it came to pass one day whilst the blessed, man Apa Victor was living in exile that the Lord Jesus came to him. Now He had changed His apparel (or, form),
and had taken the appearance of a grey-headed old man, who had come thither from a far-distant place.
And He knocked at the gate of the Camp,
and Apa Victor came outside
and when he saw the grey-headed old man he was filled with sorrow and compassion for Him
and he kissed Him, saying,
Come inside, O my lord brother, Thou good man; it seemeth to me as if I had seen Jesus this day.
And Apa Victor did not know who the old man was
and the two of them went into the tower wherein Victor lived.
Then Apa Victor said unto the man,
Let us offer up prayer to God'
and Jesus said unto him,
 Let us offer up prayer
And Apa Victor said unto Him,
Do Thou stand up first, because Thou art greater than I, and Thou art (more) holy (than I). I am nineteen years old this day,
and the sign of this world hath not as yet ceased, to manifest itself in my body, and the wickedness of this world hath not entirely disappeared from my heart.
And Jesus said unto him,
Forgive me, O my brother! I will stand up (and pray).'
And Jesus and Apa Victor spread out their hands,
and it came to pass that as they were praying the ten fingers of Jesus became ten lamps of fire which penetrated to the throne of the Father.
And it came to pass that when they had finished praying Apa Victor went forward and saluted Jesus — now he knew not who lie was — and he said unto Him
Sit Thou down so that I may be able to enjoy thy face fully, for behold, it is a very long time since I have seen a man. And I adjure Thee to inform me truthfully of what place Thou art a native, so that I may know whether Thou art a native of my own city (or not)
And Jesus said unto Him,
Thou art a Roman (Greek?) of Cilicia.
Thy father is Romanus and thy mother is Martha, and the wife whom they betrothed to thee is Theonoe; but God hath chosen thee for Himself
And Apa Victor wept in His face, and said unto Him,
O my brother, great is Thy faith.
I see that Thou art a prophet, or perhaps Thou art an angel of God.
But tell me news about my house (or, home), for behold, it is a very long time since I departed from my country.
And Jesus answered (and said)
O my brother, shew an act of lovingkindness to me, and give me a cake of bread, so that I may eat it, for it is seven days since I ate food.
And Apa Victor said unto Him
In truth, O my brother, this day is the fortieth day in which nothing hath entered my mouth, and for forty days I have not taken my clothes off my body.
And as the Lord liveth I have neither bread nor water in this wilderness, nor anything whatsoever which hath the appearance of food.
But now, O my brother, rise up, take this lamp-stand and these seats (or, stools), and also my shoe latchet, and go Thou into the city which is near and sell them at their (proper) price, and buy us some bread that we may eat, lest our souls decay through weakness.
And Jesus answered and said unto him, 'Where in this wilderness dost thou find a man with whom to hold converse? And who is it that taketh care to provide thee with food?
And Apa Victor answered and said unto Him,
Woe be unto me, O my brother! (Long will it be) before I shall arrive in that other world wherein no respect of persons is shewn. Mayest Thou find it. My Lord the Christ dwelleth there, the Apostles and the Patriarchs dwell there, and thousands of thousands, and tens of thousands of tens of thousands stand round about it.
And if any man who is a sinner shall arrive therein lie shall not find boldness (or, freedom of speech) therein, because of the sins which he hath committed, both those committed during the day and those committed during the night
As for me, how wretched shall I be in that hour! Woe is me, because of the ignorance which hath been set in the hearts of men, whereby each one faileth to remember death until the moment when it overtaketh him before he knoweth it!
Woe is me, for I have made supplication to death, but I have not found it.
 I have begged that some sickness might attack me, but it hath not done so.
Thou knowest, O my Lord, that I have made entreaty for my death more than for my life, for I am without father and without mother in this world.
I bear witness by my Lord Jesus the Christ, that if Thou departest from me this day, Thou shalt come back again and shalt visit me.
I am the servant which is unprofitable.
When I shall die Thou shalt bury my body, lest it remain lying about in this world, wherein there is no man whatsoever who shall keep me in remembrance.
Then Jesus had compassion upon Apa Victor, and He looked upon him as he wept,
and said unto him,
Dost thou know Who I am?
I am he Who delivered thee from the rack of torture at Rakote.
I am He Who delivered thee from the iron bed.
I am He Who kept thee in safety in the furnace of the bath.
I am Jesus the Christ, Who delivered thee from all thy tribulations.
I will be with thee in every place whither thou shalt go.
Grieve thou not because thou art living in this wilderness.
Amen, I say unto thee, that thou shalt be with Ale in the Jerusalem of heaven, My beloved city. And as I shall take My seat upon My throne, thou also shalt sit upon thy throne.
thou also shalt sit upon thy throne. And I will make every tyrant (or. governor) and every ruler to hold in wonder thy name whensoever they shall hear it.
And I will make them to come to thy shrine and to bring gifts unto thee in My Name.
I will make many mighty wonders and signs to become manifest at thy shrine.
Whosoever shall come to thy shrine, and shall make a vow, and shall not pay the same, because of these unpaid vows will I enter into judgement with them.
As for this tower wherein thou dwellest, the multitudes who shall come thereto shall not destroy it, (The story of) thy life and conversation and of thy great valour shall reach the uttermost ends of the earth.
This year shalt thou dwell in exile, but in the next year they shall cut off thy head with the sword in this Camp
for thou shalt suffer certain pains for My Names sake.
And I will come unto thee again, and I will give thee strength until thou shalt have put to shame the Duke and his torturings.
And straightway Apa Victor cast himself down at the feet of the Lord, saying
Who am I, that I should be deemed worthy by Thee for Thee to speak to, O my Lord?
And Jesus kissed him, and He departed into heaven, and the angels sang hymns to Him.
And Apa Victor continued to live in the Camp, and the Lord Jesus was with him.
And Apa Victor purchased for himself the materials for his burial, and his coffin.
And large numbers of soldiers flocked to the Camp for the sake of the blessed man Apa Victor.
And the blessed man Apa Victor doubled the number of the prayers which he used to make, and he ke2)t fasts for very long periods, and he diligently observed the Sabbaths, and the Lord Jesus was with him. In the peace of God, May His holy blessing be with us! Amen
And Sebastianus, the Duke, came to inspect the Camp.
And Asterius, the praetor of the Camp, cast himself down before the Count, and Soterichos, who was the accountant (or, clerk), gave him a written statement concerning Apa Victor, so that he might summon him into his presence.
Then the Duke ordered his servants to set his judgement throne inside the gate of the Camp, in order that he might hear (the case of) the holy man Apa Victor.
And when the morning had come the Duke took his seat upon the throne, and he commanded his servants to bring the righteous man into his presence.
And the torturers seized Apa Victor whilst he was in his cell, and he had lentils in his hand, and he was eating
 and Apa Victor threw the lentils through the window, saying
O my Lord Jesus the Christ, do Thou make these lentils to become stones which shall never be destroyed! And they shall be a sign unto all the generations which are to come, lest these wicked men tread them down.'
And Apa Victor prayed, saying,
O my Lord Jesus the Christ, let me not be put to shame before this wicked man.'
And afterwards he came down (from his cell), and stood before the Duke.
And the Duke said unto him,
These are the letters which the Emperor hath sent to be read unto thee; hearken unto them, and offer up sacrifice.'
Verily, I know well that I did receive a salary of sixty from my father, who is a general, and that God hated me because I received these things wickedly.
Now therefore, O Duke, neither gold nor silver will be of the least value to a man in the hour of his necessity.
For this reason let us fight with ourselves, for forgetfulness hath spread itself over our heart, so that we may never cease to remember the death (which cometh) in this world.
I have never glorified myself, and I have never exalted myself.
For this reason that which is written is fulfilled in me: 'He who exalteth himself shall be abased, and he who abaseth himself shall be exalted.'
Then Sebastianus was exceedingly wroth, and he said unto Apa Victor, 'Offer up sacrifice.'
 And Apa Victor answered and said, 'I will not offer up sacrifice.
Whatsoever thou wishest to do unto me that do.
I fell into the hands of the four torturers (?) before this, and I was not afraid of them, for the Lord gave me strength during all my torturings.
Now therefore, O Duke, I was banished to this spot because of this Name, for (they said), 'Offer up sacrifice,'
(and I would not do so). And, moreover, I do not wish to remain in this world which shall dissolve away and perish.
Be it known unto thee also, O Duke, that if thou put me to the torture many, many times, thou wilt only give additional strength to the reasoning power of the mind which is within me.
Wholly fitting for me is it that I should be held worthy to endure revilings for the Name of the Christ.'
And the Duke said unto Apa Victor,
Cease thy say; thou art always talking!
Art thou a deacon, or a reader, that thou possessest such perfect knowledge of this (kind) of wisdom?
If the blessed man Paul, the Apostle of the Gentiles,
this angel who belonged to the earth,
this man who belonged to the heavens,
who was by reason of his love and zeal well nigh the equal of Christ,
who bore the care of the Churches,
and, moreover, if this holy man, who possessed in his own person so great a multitude of spiritual excellences, and who spake out boldly, saying, 'I know not how to do anything of myself,'
was afraid, and spake in a manner,
what shall we ourselves do, who are miserable creatures, and who are wholly unable to cultivate successfully one spiritual excellence?
It is not then seemly for us to keep watch and to pray at all times, 'and to make petitions to God neither for gold not silver, nor for any riches of this world, but only for riches which are in the heavens;
Now, there are certain folk who rejoice in [their] wealth;
and some rejoice in wine-drinkings in taverns, and in eating at feasts,
For this reason it is seemly for us to take strict care of our souls at all times,
and we must say as did the Holy man David, 'God giveth strength to my beauty,'
But even if it be thy spiritual excellence flourisheth, take good heed that thy heart but not over-exalted because of thy beauty,
lest God turn His face away from thee because of thine exaltation of heart (or, pride).
He Who gave food unto all flesh fasted in the flesh for thy sake
He Who created the sweetness in the honey
 tasted that which was bitter (gall) for thy sake.
He Who ornamented the heavens with the companies of the stars
wore a crown of thorns for thy sake;
and He became obedient even unto death,
the death of the Cross.
It is not, then, seemly for us to shew ourselves glad because of these things,
nay, we must make ourselves to lament, and we must weep. Let us hearken unto that which [the Book] saith, '[Be] sorrowful in heart upon your beds
because of the things which ye have said in your hearts [during the day],' so that we may have in remembrance in the night season, and that we may heave sighs concerning them.
This is what Ahab did when he was in sorrow:
he fasted and he girded sackcloth about his body.
And what did God say concerning him? 'I will not bring the evil upon him in his days.'
It was for this same reason that the Saviour proclaimed to be blessed who weep,
not those who weep for the dead, or the loss of property,
but those who weep for their sins.
Though thyself shalt say even as did David, 'Night after night I wash my bed,
and I soak my cushion[s] with my tears.' 'Wash though away the defilement by means of tears,
smite upon thy breast,
and take to thyself the remembrance of the sins
which though hast committed.
[If] though hast been snared at [any] time through thine eye,
if though hast opened thy window at [any] time wickedly,
thou hast done injury to thy soul through thine eye.
The eyes which look with wicked intent
heal thou now with tears,
and shut thou thy window that thou mayest not see again the things of vanity,
for otherwise, thou wilt fall into an evil habit.
Now habit is wont to draw him that clingeth thereto into great sins.
[When] though hast arrived thyself splendid apparel 'take good heed unto thyself not to sit down in any [dirty] place, 'lest it become spotted.
If thou shalt hold to be in a light matter the first stain, and the second, and the third, at length thy whole garment shall become dirty.
'Thou shalt not be careless [and] sit down in any polluted place whatsoever.
What are we to do then? [Thou hast] need to fervent prayer,
lest thou strike a stone with thy feet.
And [thou shalt pray fervently] that the Angel shall compass three round about, and shall deliver thee. And thou thyself shalt be strong and shalt say, 'The Angel who delivered me out of evil,'
'And [thou shalt pray fervently] that the Angel may cry out unto thee from heaven, even as [he cried] to Abraham,
for the Angels love those who love their own God.
He (i.e., the Book) saith moreover, 'Take a psalm, set ye forth a tabret,
a sweet psaltry and a harp';
thou art to take one thing, and three are demanded from thee.
For we are composed of three things, even as the Apostle [Paul] spake, 'He will keep safe him that is in the spirit, and He will make healthy your souls and your bodies.'
Now the psaltery is in the spirit,
the harp is in the soul,
and the tabret is the dead skin which covereth it.
Therefore, put thou to death the flesh,
and this shalt thou make thyself strong to ascribe blessings to God with the tabret and dance.
For it is God Himself Who hath filled thee with flesh.
Observe, therefore, lest He should say unto thee, 'What profit is there in My blood?'
What kind of recompense canst thou possibly make to Him which shall be adequate for all the sufferings which He endured on thy behalf?
Be thou a tree which beareth fruit, and thus shall thou cause the blessing of God to be upon thee.
Bring forth fruit according to thy strength
If thou art not able to bring forth an hundredfold, which is the [number of] perfection, then bring forth sixtyfold, which is the half thereof;
If thou cast not be a vessel of gold, or silver, do not become a log of wood, or grass, or straw, which are merely fuel for the burning.
Thou shall not perform the works which God hateth, for they shall take their stand before thee on the Day of Judgement like solid image(s).
And finally thou wilt have to begin to confess them in that place without witnesses
and without an advocate, and without proofs,
and thou wilt have to look upon the deeds
which thou hast uttered unwittingly, and they shall stand up like statues before thine eyes.
So long then as we have the time let us do work,
for if the time slip through our hands,
'it is unlikely that we shall find another opportunity.
Let us then weep over the deeds which we have committted unrighteosly,
and let us make tears to flow down our cheeks in streams, and let us beat our breasts in sorrow,
'so that we may do away with the weeping , and the gnashing of the teeth in that place whereto we mus depart.
'Moreover, let us weep even as did David
in order that we may be proclaimed blessed. He did not shed a few tears only as men do when they weep,
but he flooded his bed with his tears; and he passed the whole night in vigil.
One night only he sinned,
Since, therefore, I have gone astray through mine eyes,
for this reason do away my sins through [my] tears.'
Let us come forth from our habits which are evil, , and remove ourselves into the city which is in the heavens.
'Let the careful consideration of the words of God reduce to peace the delights of the senses which are engrained in our hearts,
and which resemble those that are found in wild animals,
and let us bear at all times the death of our Lord Jesus Christ in our bodies,
The man that slumbereth shall not receive the crown of victory,
and the man that is careless and idle shall not receive the prize,
but the man who hath borne innumerable buffetings and wounds is he who shall receive honour from the Master of the contest.
Now the Enemy is in the habit of taking to flight before him that is prudent (or, cautious), but help undereth him that slumbereth.
Therefore, thou must know that thou hast about thee enemies which are evil.
Give, therefore, no sleep to thine eyes,
nor slumber to thine eyelids,
that thou mayest escape like a roe from the snare of the hunter, and like a bird from the net of the fowler.
Let us flee at all times from the cares of this world (or, life), and from the burdens thereof.
If we would make ourselves to be free from this world, we must not make to ourselves care for the things of the world,
'Flee from the knavery of the Crafty One,
and thou shalt say, ' Through Thee shall I be delivered from a company of thieves,
and through my God I shall leap over a wall.'
Seek not to excuse thyself from suffering, lest by so doing thou shalt excuse thyself from the crown also.
The merchant loseth not courage, but he endureth even the waves of the sea, and he findeth possessions.
He who contendeth is wont to fight in pain and suffering even unto wounds, for his heart looketh for the crown of victory.
The husbandman doth not find ears of corn [in his tillage] | unless he hath first of all sown the seed [thereof] by his own toil.
This is what is to be expected from the kingdom which is in the heavens: : men must account tribulations as nothing whatsoever, and they must fortify their hearts by means of the hope of the good things which shall come.
Let us therefore devote our whole attention to watching at all times, so that when our Bridegroom shall return, , and look in the bride-chamber,
If they shall cut asunder him that saith, ' My master tarrieth,' what shall they do unto him that doth not expect to see him at all?
Therefore, O my beloved, what is meet for us to do is this: We must act in such a way that we may find ourselves prepared at any hour, and we must sail a straightforward course, and always in the same direction;
for it is unlikely that we shall be able to turn back again and cultivate successfully that concerning which we have been careless.
Let us therefore be prepared at any hour, so that we may say with boldness, ' Lord, my heart is ready, my heart is ready.’
’ In this life we are in a mighty war.
The workers of evil, who are the demons, stretch their bows.
Then one of them shooteth an arrow into our ears, so that we may listen to slanderous chatterings with pleasure.
And another shooteth an arrow into our eyes, so that we may turn our gaze in a wrongful manner towards the things which are unseemly.
And another shooteth an arrow into our tongue, so as to make us to revile scornfully our brother.
And another shooteth an arrow into our belly, which exciteth in us the appetite of gluttony.
And another shooteth an arrow into our hands, which leadeth us on to deeds of rapine, and greed of the most excessive character.
Because of all these things the blessed man Paul armed us with weapons,
for he wrote saying, 'Take unto you the whole armour of God, and the helmet of the Spirit.
With these ye shall be able to quench every fiery dart of the Evil One'
Let us hearken unto the voice of the prophet, which saith, ' He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good ;
and also that which God seeketh after at thy hands, to make thyself to perform judgement and righteousness.
And thou shalt love mercy, and to prepare to follow closely after the Lord thy God.'
and sometimes He teacheth us obedience, and He bestoweth rewards upon those who hearken unto Him.
Therefore we must gird up the loins of our heart(s) in truth.
Let us keep in remembrance all the things which He suffered for our sakes.
He was made after the manner of a man for our sakes. He was suckled at the breast like a man.
He was suckled at the breast like a man. He made Himself to be a child in age (or, stature).
He received baptism for our sakes.
He suffered hunger. He slept, He slumbered for our sakes.
Let us, then, think at all times on all these things which He suffered patiently for the sake of our sins,
(and) that (the Book) saith, Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, (striving against sin).'
But ye shall fight against sin, that is to say, although we are not now asked to give our blood for the sake of Christ,
He made the blind to see, besides all these other healiugs which we put aside and do not attempt and describe one by one.
in a manner suitable for the place wherein our names are inscribed.
Now the Scripture hath called us ' strangers and sojourners ', so that we may think scorn of the things of this place (i. e., world).
The pleasure of this world is like unto a day (Coptic reads: dog):
if we chase him away, he fleeth; and if we feed him, he will abide with thee.
It is for this reason that Aiakk6bos (James) said, 'Resist ye the j Devil, and he shall flee from you.'
Let us not think in our minds that we shall be able to repent in Amente,
 for the medicine of repentance hath no effect in that place.
For although we shall gnash with our teeth, and our tongue shall be on fire, there shall be in that place none who shall dip his finger in water for us;
on the contrary, we ourselves shall hear the words which the rich man heard.
Let us know, then, O my beloved, that the works of this changing (world) are nothing but phantasms (or, dreams), and that we live in a house wherein travellers are received, out from which we must go forth in any case.
Let us take care concerning the road, and concerning the provisions which we must take with us on the road.
Let us array ourselves in the garments which appertain to this life, concerning which Paul counselled us, saying, 'Dress yourselves in the bowels of mercies, and in goodness, and in humility'
In that place we shall have no need of gold, but we shall have need of the dropping of water.
We shall have no need of the leaves of trees and plants, but of the fruit thereof. We shall have no need of words, but of deeds.
For He (i. e., Christ) said, ' It is not every one who shall say unto Me, Lord, Lord, that shall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he who doeth the Will of My Father which (is) in heaven/
Let us therefore by no manner of means deceive ourselves.
For in this world both the good things and the evil things which are therein fulfil themselves.
In that world, however, the good things endure, and exist for ever and for ever, and the punishments are endless.
In this world, if the body burnetii, the soul cometh forth therefrom, and it existeth undestroyed.
If a man be unable to bear the heat of the bath which hath been heated to an unwonted degree, what will he do when he is delivered over to the river of fire which floweth before the throne of Christ?
It is necessary that every man should make himself to consider the fire which is there.
Let us examine carefully the seal which is on our gold and see that it is intact, lest peradventure some come and plunder our treasure.
If the prophet Jeremiah wept over the overthrow of the temple, which had been built throughout with stones of price, saying, ' Leave me alone, let me weep bitterly,' how much more is it right for us to weep over the temple of ourselves, which is exceedingly glorious,
If we look upon one who is dead, we weep over him according to custom, what man is there who would be altogether so foolish as not to weep for his own soul if it had died in sin?
Remember thou, then, that the time hath drawn nigh,
Let us rise up out of the slumber of dreams, and let us make (or, bring forth) fruits worthy of repentance, even as it is written.
Repentance requireth not a long time, and very many of the martyrs received the crown for (the repentance) of a short time.
And moreover, it belongeth to the nature of men to go astray in the work,
but it is the work of Satan to persist in the going astray.
For this reason our God cried out to us through the prophet saying, 'Is there no balsam in Gilead?
Or is there no physician in that place?
Why then hath not the healing of the daughter of my people increased?'
If it should happen that any member in our body become diseased, are we not wont to send for the physicians, and to make all the haste possible until we have healed that sick member in our body?
When, however, the soul itself is sick we are careless about it, and we take no care whatsoever about the healing thereof.
Let us hold in fear Him that hath the power to destroy our soul and our body in Gehenna.
The Good Shepherd standeth wishing to snatch away our souls from out of the mouth of the lion before he is able to devour them.
He crieth out unto us ourselves saying, 'My son, thou hast sinned; do not (sin) again'
And again He saith, Shall not he who falleth rise up again?
Or shall not he who hath gone astray turn again into the right way?'
And again He saith, 'Turn ye yourselves unto Me, My children (or, sons) who have wandered afar off, and I will heal your wounds of contrition.'
He was no liar who said, 'I have not come to judge the world, but in order that the world might have salvation through Me'
The one thing for us to do is to repent.
For He saith, 'I do not desire the death of the sinner, but that he would turn himself from his evil way, and live'
as that in which God loveth the soul which repenteth.
For the lovingkindness of God towards man is in this wise:
He never rejecteth him that setteth forth to come to Him with repentance.
And if he hath fallen into the ditch, and into evil, yet will He stretch out widely His hands to him saying, ' Turn thou to Me, and I will save thee'
Doth there exist a physician who, supposing it to be his wish to make him that is sick to recover a little, would reproach him
The physician doth not treat him with contempt, neither doth he award him the just retribution for his disgraceful state, but he administereth unto him the medicine with gentleness.
How much more then shall God, Who is in truth the Good Physician of our souls (act thus towards us)?
Above all things let us not despair of our own salvation.
For he who contendeth in the games is wont to fall down often, but in the end he riseth up, and receiveththe crown of victory.
So also is it with the soldier. After he hath been wounded (the physicians) heal him, and he wageth war again, and men consider him to be of greater value than those who have not been wounded at all.
Similarly also there are very many merchants who, although their ships have foundered, and they have lost their cargoes, do not despair,
but they go back again regularly to the markets,
For the burning fire of Gehenna hath not been prepared solely for us, but it was made ready for the Devil and his angels.
Above all things let us not kindle that fire for ourselves, and let us not hear besides the words, (Get ye into the fire which ye yourselves have kindled)
There is no sick man living who cannot be healed by the medicine of the Physician of our souls.
But perhaps thou wilt say, ' I certainly cannot attain unto perfection.'
If thou art not able to attain unto perfection, and if thou art not able to become like a sun, then make thyself to be like unto a star.
In any case transfer thyself from earth to heaven. Make thyself to be like a star which sendeth forth light.
how much more shall He give us wages for our good works, even though they be very few?
Therefore let us labour for a little time, so that we may at last live the life which is for ever.
If it were possible for us to die many, many times, it would be seemly for us to do so, so that we might see Christ coming in His glory.
We shall not see Him in a riddle, but we shall | see Him as He really is, with our own eyes, according to the testimony of the Apostle John, who preached concerning God.
If we look upon the beauty of the human body in this place (i. e., world) we are wont to marvel thereat.
Now the beauty of human bodies ariseth from humours and from heat, which after death turn into worms, and ashes, and corruption.
How much more, then, shall we admire when we look upon that beauty which is incorruptible, and spotless, and pure?
Since Peter, when he saw only the very smallest portion of the light of the glory
thereof, said, 'It is good for us to remain in this place'
what shall happen unto us when we shall look upon the fullness of that glory?
If we ascribe blessings to those who are nigh unto a king in this world, when we see him advancing upon a chariot of gold, and wearing the crown and apparel of purple, then how greatly blessed shall we be when we are placed on the right hand of the King of All, the Judge of every man.
Now supposing that a kingdom had been promised unto thee, and that the road to the country wherein the kingdom was situated was exceedingly difficult, and toilsome, and was a place of desolation and steepness : wouldst thou not endure all these things in order to reach that kingdom?
Thou shalt not say, I am already snared in my sins, and I am not able to turn myself to God/
for even if the Devil hath first of all cast us down headlong, let us rise up quickly.
For our God is a lover of mankind.
Whomsoever shall flee unto Him He will receive, even as He did in the case of the young man who had squandered the portion of the riches which had fallen to his share.
Let no whoremonger and tax-gatherer be before us to enter into the Kingdom.
There are many medicines and many remedies established for us in Holy Scripture which are different each from the other.
Ahab sorrowed in his heart because of the sin which he had committed, and he escaped from the wrath of God by means of this medicine. And Nebuchadnezzar (βαλτασαρ) (escaped) through mercy.
The thief became a citizen of the Paradise through faith
Therefore will we exalt these salves and these medicines.
Let us ourselves say unto the True Physician, 'Heal me, O God, and I shall become whole and Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee'
and the True Physician shall receive us to Himself. And He shall say, I, even I, am He Who blotteth out thy sin, and I will no more remember it'
and if thou canst not wash away thy sins by means of thy tears like the harlot, flee thou to the foot of the Merciful, and thou thyself shalt say, with David, 'Have mercy upon me, O God, according to the greatness of Thy mercy.'
For this reason I am in need of the greatness of the mercy of Thy lovingkindness towards man.
Nevertheless, thou must certainly shew Him thy wound, and thou shalt say, ' Have mercy upon me. Have mercy upon my body, and upon my soul.
Behold, He Himself will sell unto thee the kingdom which is in the heavens.
If thou art not able to buy it for copper (money), buy it for thyself with a little piece of bread, for He will sell thee the kingdom which is in the heavens for this.
Now he who seeketh after that which is sold may not have with him the means (or, possessions) to give in exchange for it.
If (thou hast) not (these things), then give the innocence of thy soul, give fastings, give tears.
If thou dost fast, guard thyself lest thy heart become proud;
Nay, more (than this). If the day of fasting shall cause thee to be regarded (by men) with close attention, thou shalt consider what it is which thou hast acquired for thyself through the fasting, lest thou find thyself to be on a lower level than before thou didst fast.
Moreover, observe what kind of sin it is which thou hast abandoned, or for what purpose thou hast abandoned it,
and what kind of success it is which thou hast acquired for thyself,
or what manner of defect it is which thou hast corrected through thy fasting.
See if thou hast cured thyself of cursing and swearing, and if thou hast laid aside words of obscenity, or words of ribaldry, or words of lewdness.
See what manner of good thing* it is which thou hast gotten for thyself.
If thou hast abandoned (the eating of) bread overmuch, and of other kinds of food, but hast not abandoned passion, nor hast gotten for thyself spiritual excellences, in what way then hast thou benefited by the fasting?
In that Other World one man shall not be able to give help to another, and no man shall be able to deliver himself from the decision of the Judge, wherefrom no escape may be obtained by supplication.
In that place of judgement neither Moses, nor Noah, nor Daniel, nor even Abraham himself, the lover of children, shall be able to protect one of his children from the punishment.
Let us keep in remembrance the fact that we are guilty of very many sins, both of those which are secret and of those which are manifest.
Now, he (i. e., David) saith, ' If thou shalt mark carefully every iniquity, who is there that shall stand?
And why need I speak of the sins which are hidden?
If He were to judge us only for those which are manifest, what chance of escape would there be for us?
Now when we talk with our friends we are in the habit of addressing them with the greatest respect and deference, but when we pray to God Himself for our sins we habitually do this with carelessness,
If, moreover, He were to bring forward (or, into the midst) the charges which we have uttered against each other, and the jealousy, and the hatred, what should we do?
 should we ever be able to look boldly into heaven at all?
If He were to look closely into our behaviour in respect of the acts of deceit which we have done to each other, and of how, when our brother was present with us, we held converse with him as a friend,
but when he was absent we heaped abuse of every kind upon him as if he had been an enemy (what should we do?).
should we not be condemned to most severe punishment because of our behaviour in this respect.
If He were to exact punishment from us for our carelessness in our assemblies for the Holy Communion, wherein God Himself speaketh to us in the Scriptures,
but we pay no attention to Him, and we hold converse with our fellow-servants,
should we not then be condemned to a punishment of great severity, because of our behaviour in this respect?
For this reason let us set Gehenna before our eyes at all seasons.
And even if we had not been threatened definitely with Gehenna, it would have been meet for us to keep our sins in our memory at all times, (and seeing that) this Gehenna is ready for us, how much more are we bound to keep our sins in remembrance?
Remember thou the Judge.
For behold, he (i. e., the Book) spake unto thee aforetime concerning the punishment so that thou mightest make thy escape from the danger.
If He were to command thee saying, Fast thou thou couldst find an excuse for not doing so in thy weakness.
If He were to say unto thee, 'Give money in charity thou couldst find an excuse for not doing so in thy poverty.
If He were to say unto thee, Collect nothing in this world thou couldst find an excuse in the necessity for providing for thy son.
But if He were to say unto thee, ' Be not angry, bear no malice against, have no hatred for, treat not with contumely him that is thy neighbour,' what wouldst thou reply in respect of these things?
Moreover, on many occasions thou hast said, 'They have treated me unjustly, they have defrauded me of my property, they have done me an injury, and they have spoken evil things against me ';
but thou hadst only to wait for the decision of the governor.
How much more is it meet for thee to leave the matter unto Him Who said, 'Cast the judgement upon Me ; I will repay, saith God.'
Thou knowest, therefore, that it will be necessary for thee to take thy stand before the Awful Throne, where neither advocate nor possessions shall be able to assist thee,
and that thy soul shall come forth on the ' river of flame which floweth before the throne of Christ ',
even as the fathers say who have been in that place before thee.
Let the fountain of thy tears be in size according to the measure of the sins which thou hast committed.
If thy sins be few, then a little shedding of tears will suffice.
If thy transgression be great, then thou wilt have need of overwhelming torrents of tears.
If, however, thou thyself art free from sin, then shed thou thy tears on behalf of thy brother to a suitable degree, and weep with him for his sins.
Let us repent before the door of repentance be shut in our teeth (or, mouth).
For this reason (was said) that which was said, ' Let him that thinketh he standeth look carefully lest he fall.'
Let him that is in a slippery place, and hath fallen, make haste to rise up (again), for he must not abandon himself to despair.
For it is written, ' God upholdeth those who fall'
And it happeneth that a man moveth sometimes a very little, according to that which and my feet would have moved ; and very little more and my steps would have slipped
Then again, ' They thrust sore at me to make me fall, but God gave me [His] hand
He who hath fallen hath, in these ensamples, an encouragement not to allow himself to remain | in his fallen state, and he (i.e., the Book) saith, ' Shall not he that is in the habit of falling rise up again?
Verily it is written, God, the True Judge, is longsuffering and merciful';
and He receiveth (or, accepteth) the repentance of those who shall turn unto Him, as one Who loveth men.
Listen, for the Book saith l He will sharpen it
Now hitherto He hath not made use of it to smite, for He thought that when thou didst see Him sharpening His sword,
thou wouldst anticipate the passing of the sentence, and that fear would rouse thee up to repentance.
For the Book saith, He hath stretched His bow, He hath made it ready.'
Because thou hast not yet seen the arrow, presume not on the mercifulness of the Judge.
Listen to (the words of) longsuffering of the Saviour Who said, 'Agree thou with him that goeth to law with thee Now the adversary, that is to say, he that fighteth with thee, is with thee at all times.
And that it is unlikely that thou wilt be able to rid thyself of him Paul teacheth thee saying, The flesh lusteth against our spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; these, moreover, war against each other.'
Now the spirit warreth against the flesh, and it bringeth into subjection the lust of this world through the hope of the kingdom which is in the heavens.
THE LIFE AND CONVERSATION OF OUR HOLY FATHER, WHO WAS GLORIOUS IN EVERY WAY, APA ONNOPHRIOS THE ANCHORITE, WHO ENDED HIS LIFE ON THE SIXTEENTH DAY OF THE MONTH PAONE IN THE PEACE OF GOD!
BLESS US! AMEN.
A CERTAIN brother who was an anchorite, and whose name was Apa Pa[p]noute, made a discourse to the God-loving brethren,
and these were the words which he addressed to them. I, [your] brother, was thinking one day, and I determined to go into the inner desert, so that I might see if there were any brethren who were monks living in the most remote parts of it.
I marched four days and four nights, and I neither ate bread nor drank water. I marched on into the inner desert,
and at the end of a [further number] of days I came upon a cave.
And when he had gazed upon me he repeated the prayer in the Gospel.
And I urged him to take me into the cave.
And he asked me 'Wherefore didst thou come to this place?'
And I said, 'I came to this place because I wished to see the servants of God who live in this desert, and God hath not denied me that which I asked of Him.'
And I asked him, saying, ' How didst thou come to this place? And how long ago is it since thou didst come here? And what dost thou usually eat? And why dost thou go naked and wear no € clothing on thy body?
Afterwards I meditated in my heart upon what I had done, and I grieved, and wept exceedingly, and I was always heaving sighs.
Afterwards I meditated in my heart upon what I had done, and I grieved, and wept exceedingly, and I was always heaving sighs.
And I thought in my heart when I was alone, saying, ‘If I were to die to-day or to-morrow they would punish us with a severe punishment, with the gnashing of teeth, and with outer darkness, and with the fire that cannot be quenched, and with the worm that never sleepeth, and that devoureth the soul.
And I wished to escape from the sin.
And I rose up and came forth, and I departed into the desert,
and I have never been with that woman since I have been here.
And I found this spring- of water, and this palm tree, and this cave.
This palm-tree yieldeth twelve bunches of dates each year, a bunch for each month,
and one bunch of dates is sufficient to last me for the month.
I possess nothing, neither raiment nor the food of bread.
My hair increaseth, and as my clothes were worn out utterly long ago,
I clothe myself, as is most seemly, with the raiment of my hair.
And behold, it is thirty years since I came to this place, and the climate thereof bestoweth upon me health uniformly. And I never eat bread.'
And I asked him, 'At first when thou didst come to this place, didst thou suffer greatly?'
And he said unto me, 'Yea, I did suffer greatly, so much so in fact that sometimes through the intensity of my sorrow I used to throw myself on the ground, and cry up to God because of my manifold sins.
And I also suffered great pain through an infirmity which was upon me.
 [One day] I looked and I saw a man who was exceedingly splendid standing by me,
and he said unto me, “In what part of the body art thou ill?”
And my strength returned unto me a little, and I said unto him, “I am ill in my liver.”
And he said unto me, “Shew me the place wherein thou art ill,”
and I shewed him the place where my liver was in pain.
And he stretched out his hand upon me, and his fingers rested upon each other, and he made an opening between mⲩ ribs as with a sword (or, knife), and he brought forth my liver, and he shewed me the wounds that were in it,
And I cast myself down at his feet so that he might remember and bless me.
And he blessed me, saying,' The Lord bless thee! May He deliver thee from the snares of the Devil, and may He set thee on all His good paths at all times, and mayest thou escape to the saints.”
And when he had finished blessing me my strength came to me to such a degree that I never felt when I was hungry or when I was thirsty.
And when I perceived the great marvel that had come to me I rose up, and I journeyed into the mountain.
And when four days had passed by I felt pain, and I stretched out my hands to heaven,
and I prayed, and behold the man who had come unto me at first again came unto me,
and he gave unto me strength as at the first.
In short, when four days had passed I journeyed on into [the desert].
And straightway I looked, and I saw a man in the distance, and he was an exceedingly terrifying object, for his hair was spread out over his body like that of a panther, and he was naked, and his privy parts were covered with leaves.
I also am a man of the mountain like unto thyself, and I am living in the desert because of my sins.'
And he said unto me, ' Thou art a friend (?) of God.'
And I sat down before him, and I conjured him to tell me his name.
And he said unto me, 'Onnophrios is my name. And behold, I have lived in this desert for sixty years. I wander about in the mountains like the wild animals, and I never see any man who recognizeth me.
I lived at one time in a habitation of monks, in the mountain of Shmun of the Thebaid.
And the name of that monastery was Erete.
We all lived together, and each of us was of the same mind, and peace dwelt in our midst. We lived with each other a life of quiet contemplation, and we ascribed glory unto God.
And I passed nights in vigil with them, and I learned the rules of God from them; and their chief men were perfect even as the angels of the Lord.
And I heard them speaking about our father Elijah, the Tishbite, and saying that he was wholly powerful in God while he lived in this desert .
John the Baptist also, than whom of all those who have been born of women none hath arisen who is greater than he. He lived in the desert-places until the day of his manifestation before Israel.
Then the Duke made his servants to strip Apa Victor naked, and to cut his sinews, and to fasten his hands behind him, and to drive skewers into him
and afterwards he made them to dismember (?) him.
And the Duke said unto him, 'Offer up sacrifice.'
And Apa Victor said unto him, 'I will not offer up sacrifice.'
And afterwards he made his servants to break the joints of his legs and arms until his bones stuck out through his skin.
And Apa Victor said unto him,
I give thanks unto Thee, O my Lord Jesus the Christ, because all the joy of the Christ hath drawn nigh unto me.'
Duke said unto him,
They delivered thee over into my hands as a magician.
Now, then, if thou dost not hearken unto me, I will torture thee with the most terrible tortures.'
And Apa Victor said, 'I will not offer up sacrifice.'
And the Duke said unto him,
Why dost thou not go on taking thy salary? Why dost thou take no pleasure in thy chariot and in thine armour?'
And Apa Victor answered and said,
Because they are used in acts of violence.
For this reason I will not eat the rations
I have in the world which is to come spiritual food laid up fox me, and when I shall have eaten thereof I shall never feel hunger again.'
And the Duke commanded them to strip him naked, and to east him into a furnace wherein the fire had been lighted for two days.
And afterwards they brought him into the presence of the Duke, who said unto him,
O wicked head! I swear by the health of Apollo that thy punishment shall be the destruction of thy body by fire.'
And the Duke commanded (his servants) to prepare a furnace, and to heat it for four days, and then to cast Apa Victor into it.
And Apa Victor prayed in the depths of the furnace, saying,
O my Lord Jesus the Christ, at the (mention of) Whose Name the sea dried up, let [this] fire be extinguished, and let the heat thereof be destroyed. Blessed be Thy Name for ever! Amen.'
And they brought him and set him before the Duke, (and it was found that) the fire had not touched him.
Then Sebastianus said unto Apa Victor,
By the glorious gods Apollo and Artemis, I will torture thee (sorely),
I will Send and bring a magician who is more powerful than thou, (and) he shall make an end of thy magic'
And the Duke commandcd them to bring a magician.
And the magician (came), and he made medicaments (containing) the essence and the venom of serpents,
and he pronounced over them a very large number of (magical) names.
And after (this) he said unto Apa Victor,
Take (these), swallow them, and then I shall see if thou art strong enough (to suffer in no way thereby).'
And the blessed man Apa Victor said unto the magician,
I have no desire to swallow them, but in order that thou mayest know that my God hath power to make of no effect every kind of magic, (I will do so).'
Then the magician said,
Mighty is he who hath shewn might! Thou hast delivered (thy) soul from death, and made it to live once again.
For (it is with thee as it was with) Andrew, when he was broken on the cross, he was made new again.
And this is what happeneth unto those who have gone astray in their sins; when they wish (it) the Lord maketh them into new creatures again.'
And straightway the magician relinquished all the possessions which he had, and he was taught the Name of the Holy Trinity, and all his books which were full of magic he burned in the fire.
And the Duke said unto Apa Victor,
Be wise, and offer up sacrifice.'
And Apa Victor said unto him,
Indeed I am wise at all times.'
And the Duke said unto him, 'But this time thou art acting the fool.'
And Apa Victor said, 'The fools of the world are those whom God hath chosen to put to shame the wise.'
The Duke said unto him, 'Where is this writing found?'
And Apa Victor said, 'It is Paul who wrote it.'
And the Duke said, 'Is Paul then a god?'
And Apa Victor said unto him,
And the Duke was wroth, and he commanded (his servants) to tear out the intestines from his body down to his feet.
And Apa Victor spake before the Duke, saying
The tendons, nerves, and sinews which thou hast dragged out from my body are like unto the pointed instruments where- with (the physicians) probe a wound in order to liberate the fetid pus which is in it, and to give relief to the whole body.
That is the case with me at this moment.
And now I will give thanks unto my Lord Jesus the Christ, for ever and ever. Amen.'
And the Duke made (his servants) bring some oil, and they lighted a fire under it, and kept it burning until the oil was boiling.
And he made them pour it upon his necessary organs, and immediately the oil had been poured upon them they fell off on the ground.
And the blessed man Apa Victor answered and said,
This oil which thou hast poured upon me is like unto the cool water which a man is wont to drink during the hot w^eather, and in which he washeth himself so that he may feel the relief thereof from the heat in his whole body.'
And the Duke commanded (his servants) to hoist him up on the rack of torture, and to stretch him thereon, and he made them put six burning torches close to his body; and they racked him for a period of two hours.
And the Duke said unto him,
O wicked head! I weary myself.
I would spare thee from being put to shame, thou wilt not turn (i. e, repent).
Come now, offer up sacrifice.'
And Apa Victor said unto him,
Yesterday thou didst spare me; to-day spare thou me not.
Do whatsoever it pleaseth thee to do unto me.'
And the Duke commanded (his servants) to pour vinegar and ashes into his mouth.
And Apa Victor said,
'This vinegar and these ashes, which thou makest me to drink, are like unto honey dropped down my throat.'
Then the Duke commanded his servants to dig out his two eyes whilst he was alive.
And straightway the executioners came and thrust red-hot knives into his eyes and ears
and forthwith his two eyeballs were ripped out and fell upon the ground. And a smoke (i. e. dizziness) mounted up in his brain.
And Apa Victor said unto the Duke,
Even if thou hast the power and dost make blind the eyes of my body, I have still left within me other eyes,
that is to say, those of the mind and understanding, which will give me light, according to that which Peter the Apostle said
 If it be that ye see with the eyes of the body, ye shall see the works of the world, which are vain, that is to say, fornication, and slandering, and murder, and calumny, and pride, because of which things the wrath of God cometh.'
Therefore I have no need of the eyes of my body.
And the Duke answered and said unto him,
'If thou wilt compel me now to inflict further severe tortures upon thee, (I must do so).'
And Apa Victor said unto him,
Inflict upon me any punishment thou wishest to inflict
for I am prepared to bear up under it. only take care to spare me not.'
Then the Duke commanded (his servants) to hang him up on a pillar head downwards
And Apa Victor said unto the Duke,
Even though thou strippest off me my skin which is outside me, I have still another skin, which is inside me, and which neither thy power nor thy tortures can injure.
And again, though thou shalt cut out my tongue, God is wont to perform judgement (on behalf of) those whose mouths are silenced.
Now, therefore, I care nothing for thy tortures.'
And whilst the blessed man Apa Victor was saying these things, behold, a certain young woman whose name was Stephanou, who was the wife of a soldier,
looked out through her window — now she was about fifteen years of age — and cried out, saying,
Blessed art thou, O Apa Victor, and blessed art thou in all thy works.
All thy sacrifices have been received from thy hands, even as were received the sacrifices of Abel, the righteous man, which he brought unto God in integrity of heart.
God shall shew compassion upon thee as He did upon Enoch, the scribe of righteousness.
Thou art perfect and righteous in thy generation as was Noah.'
Thou dost lay thy body on the altar as a sacrifice, as did Isaac.
Thou dost manifest patient endurance, as did Jacob at the time when Esau pursued him (when he was) going to Laban.
Thou art a man of wisdom and understanding, as was Daniel the Prophet.
Thou hast been instructed in divine things by thy dreams like Joseph.
Thou hast manifested patient endurance like Job, the man of God.
The Enemy hath been envious of thee as he was of Isaiah the Prophet, whose body they sawed in twain lengthwise with a wood saw. And the fire hath not touched thee, even as the fire of Nebuchadnezzar touched not the Three Holy (Children).
Thou hast given thy heart unto God, even as did David, the son of Jesse.
Behold, I swear by thy salvation, Apa Victor, that two crowns shall be sent down from heaven being borne by twenty-four angels
one of these is for thee, and the other shall be for me. Though like thee I am a vessel of infirmity, I shall have an inheritance among the mighty ones.
And when the Duke heard this woman proclaiming these things, he commanded his soldiers to bring her unto him.
And when they had brought her, the Duke said unto her,
How many years old art thou that thou dost dare to proclaim these violent words in such an impudent manner?
And she said unto him,
I am fifteen years and eight months old.
And the Duke said unto her,
How many years is it since thou didst marry (thy) husband?
And she said unto him,
Behold, one year and six months.'
MAY HIS HOLY BLESSING COME UPON US, AND MAY WE BE SAVED! AMEN.
And it came to pass in the time of Apa Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet, after he had protected the body of the blessed woman Hillaria, the daughter of the Emperor Zeno,
A vision was shewn to him, [and a voice said unto him,] 'Rise up, and go thou into the district which is on the sea-coast,
and thou shalt enquire for the anchorite, of whose sandals there is not in the whole world anyone who is worthy to unloose the latchets.'
And the blessed Apa Pambo rose up and went into the desert in the strength of God which was with him, even as it was with the blessed Antonius at the time when he was on his journey to go to the blessed man Apa Paulus a second time.
And Apa Pambo answered, saying, 'Hail thou, Apa Hierax, who hast become a companion of the angels of God by reason of thy purity.'
And Apa Hierax opened the door, and brought in Apa Pambo, and they sat down together.
And Apa Pambo said unto him, 'My beloved brother Apa Hierax, behold, is it very many years since thou didst come to this place?'
And Apa Hierax said unto Pambo, 'Behold, I have been in this place eighteen years, and I have never eaten any of the foods which are usually eaten in this world, but I have lived upon the fruit of trees.'
Now there was a palm-tree growing outside that cell, and it produced twelve clusters, one cluster each month,
and he lived upon the fruit thereof.
And I, Pambo, said unto him, 'My beloved father, are there any brethren living beyond thee in the desert?'
And Apa Hierax said, 'There are some;
bless me, and get thee gone to them, and receive a blessing at their hands.
And having departed from him into the mountain I came to a small cell of a monk,
and I called into it according to the rule of the monkish brethren.
And as I stood outside it, the brother made answer unto me from the inside, saying, 'Hail, Apa Pambo, the elder of the church of Shiet, thou mighty ship that sailest over the desert that is without water,
And when we had saluted each other, we offered up prayer, and we sat down.
And I said unto him, ' My father, I know that thou must be cold in winter, and thou wilt not be burnt up with the heat in the summer, when wearing a tunic of this kind.'
And Apa Pamoun said unto me, because this, most certainly, is its name, O my beloved brother Apa Pambo.
Believe me, O my beloved father, behold, it is twenty years ago since I came to this place, and with this single garment I have found means to keep myself warm during the winter, and to moderate the heat of the atmosphere in summer time.
And I confess unto thee that this tunic will suffice for me until the day of my death;
and, moreover, when I am dead it will be large enough for them to roll me up in it until the day of the Judgement of Truth.'
And I said unto him, 'My beloved father, is there any brother living beyond thee in the desert?'
And he said unto me, 'There is one brother the latchet of one of whose sandals all the whole world is not worthy to unloose.
I myself went to him many times, wishing to visit him,
and he used to answer me from the inside of his cell, saying, 'Get thee gone! In coming hither thou hast given thyself trouble [to no purpose].
No man of flesh shall see my face, except the elder of the church of Shiet.'
And I said unto him, 'Nay, it is not ordained thus, and it is not for this purpose that I have come to this place.
But I will remember thee if the Lord maketh straight my way so that I may meet that brother.
And, my father, do thou remember me until I shall enjoy the blessing of that brother.'
And when I had journeyed into the mountain about the distance of a mile — now I, Pambo, the least of men, swear unto thee by the awful throne of God, and I do not lie in what I am going to say — the being who seized the prophet Habakkuk in ancient days, and carried him, and the food which was in his hands, and brought him to the pit of the lions [when] Habakkuk gave it (i.e. the food) to Daniel who was in the pit of the lions,
this same being, I say, seized me under the impulse of the Spirit, and brought me to the little habitation of that brother.
And I knocked at the door, according to the rule of the monkish brethren, and I stood still at the door for a long time.
And after these things the brother answered me from within, saying, 'Hail, Apa Pambo, thou elder of the church of Shiet, thou mighty ship that sailest over the desert that is without water.
Then I remembered the patriarch Jacob, and how he, when he fled from the face of Esau his brother, went into Mesopotamia of Syria, and how when he had arrived at the place wherein were the sheep of Laban
he went up to the well, and rolled away the stone which was on the mouth thereof, without any man giving him assistance, and how he watered the sheep of Laban and then sent them away to feed.
And finally I understood that in everything that the saints perform it is God Who helpeth them.
And I said unto him, 'O my holy father, shew me thy holy name, for God hath hidden this from me.'
And he said, 'Cyrus is my name.
I am the brother of the Emperor Theodosius, and I was reared and fed at the same table as Arcadius and Honorius. And, indeed, many, many times hath Honorius said unto me, 'Take me with thee into the desert, and I will become a monk';
but I did not wish to take him with me, because he is a son of the Emperor.
And when we saw that oppression (or, violence) had multiplied, and that the Emperors were committing' sin, and that the rulers were robbing the poor, and that everyone was turning out of the straight road, and making corrupt his path before God, I rose up, and I set out and I came to this desert, and I took up my abode therein because of the multitude of my sins.
May God forgive me these!'
And I, Pambo, said unto him, 'My beloved father, where a wilt thou find men in this desert place to comfort thee in thy sufferings?'
And Apa Cyrus said unto me, 'Believe me, my beloved brother, Apa Pambo, my God and my Lord Jesus Christ are Those Who visit me in this desert wherein I live.
For I have never seen a man who came to me except a certain brother who was a monk, and who came hither wishing to see my face, besides such a one I have never seen anyone.
Now, therefore, may God bless thee because of the refreshing (or, rest) which thou hast given unto me during the little time which I have been with thee; and may my soul rest with thee for ever!
And now I am going to a strange country, and into a city that is not mine, wherein I shall beg from one person after another, and wherein I shall be a helpless and a most miserable stranger.
Verily, O my mother I am become an orphan, fatherless and motherless.
If at this present time a man goes away on a journey into a far country, whether in connection with trafficking- or whether for some other purpose
when he cometh back after a long time to his house he will find his servants and his parents and his kinsfolk alive; and if he hath suffered tribulation in the strange land he will forget his sufferings, because he will find all his people safe and sound.
On the other hand, wretched and miserable is that man who, when he goeth on a journey into a strange country, must abide in exile until he die,
and indeed, such is my own case this day. I am going to make myself a stranger unto thee, and unto all the people of my house.
Swear by thy salvation, O my mother, that thou wilt not neglect to enquire after my body.
If I die, be not forgetful of my youth.
Remember, O my mother, that I passed nine months in thy womb before thou didst bring me forth, and that I drank at thy breasts for three years
Then straightway his mother and his slaves wept (for him), for he was a kind-hearted man, and would hearken unto the man of no account as well as unto the noble.
And his mother said
Look at me, O my son Victor.
What hath happened to thee?
Could not the Emperor have sentenced thee to pay a fine of gold or silver
rather than have made thee endure these things and banishment to a remote city?
Explain to me why it is that thou art in this disgraceful state.
Explain to me so that I may sacrifice my own soul (or, life) to save thee.
Is not thy father present in the Palace that the Emperor hath done these things unto thee?
And Apa Victor said unto his mother
All these things have happened unto me because of my father, but God shall, in truth, forgive him, O my mother.
Had it not been for the Emperor my father would have cut off my head.
A stranger hath had compassion upon me
and my father hath not had compassion upon me this year.
O my mother, if my father shall do evil (?) shall he not die ?
Diocletian shall become blind before he dieth, he shall receive alms at the g-ate of the city of Antioch, and his seed shall perish quickly, because he hath persecuted the Name of the Lord Jesus.
 Woe be unto every one who shall hearken unto him, for their habitation shall be the pit of the abyss for ever, and their father is the Devil.
And his mother said unto Apa Victor
Dost thou not know that in the coming month I am going to take thy bride for thee?
And Apa Victor said unto his mother
O my mother, what use is it for thee to bring me a bride, and to put riches of every kind into my hands?
For it is written
The world shall pass away and the desirable things thereof, but he who shall do the will of God shall abide for ever.
Now therefore, O my mother, do thou the will of God, so that thou mayest live for ever.
For gold and silver rust, (fine) raiment becometh moth-eaten and falleth into holes,- a man dieth and he turneth into corruption in the tomb, and the remembrance of him perisheth on the earth; but the righteous man shall never be moved.
O my mother, say not in thy heart that possessions are of value, for they have no value with God, Who can make the poor man into a rich man, and the rich man into a poor man before the sun shall set this day.
After these things he set out and departed, and he took off the ring which was on his finger, and gave it to his mother, and he prayed to God in the following words, saying
Jesus, my Lord, Who sittest upon the chariot of the Cherubim and Seraphim,' (Whom theca angels) stand before. Whom the denizens of the heavens call  'Sabaoth,' ' Whom the peoples  on the earth ll Jesus the Christ ', Whom the nations call 'the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit', keep Thou  me without movement (i. e. steadfast), and without, trepidation.
Lead Thou me not into temptation, for I am not capable of hearing up against it, but deliver me from the Evil One. For unto Thee belong the power and the glory for ever. Amen.
O my Lord, be Thou with me in every place wherein they shall take me for I know not whither they will carry me.
After these words he blessed all his household and saluted (i. e. kissed) them.
And he sealed the door of his bedroom in the Name of thee Christ Jesus, and come out, and said
O my house and my servants, truly I am departing from you, and I am departing from thee, O my mother; never again after this moment shall I return to gaze upon you.
Remember, O my servants, that I have never neglected (?) any one of you, or (any) stranger.
I am not like unto other young men who are uninstructed, and I have never spoken a word out of place, but I have paid to the humble man the respect that was due to his humble estate, and to the noble the honour that was due to his exalted degree.
Verily, O my mother, with the very same treatment which I have meted out to the general and the eparoh, have I treated the man who was poor and him who was wretched, and I have paid honour unto them as unto God
I have never for a single day manifested any sign of haughtiness and pride, for I knew that each and every one of us must die.
And after these things Apa Victor came out and joined himself unto the soldiers
and they put the gag in his mouth
and they seized him, and dragged him along
and placed him in a boat; and when they had arrived at Rakote, they transferred him to the prison
and they delivered the letter (of the Emperor) to Armenins, Count of Rakote.
And at the third hour of the twentieth day of Pharmoute, the soldiers took the letter and had it read to the Duke, according to that which Diocletian had written therein.
THE SECOND MARTYRDOM OF SAINT APA VICTOR THEGENERAL.
IN THE PEACE OF GOD. MAY HIS HOLY BLESSING COME UPON US, AND MAY WE ALL RE SAVED. AMEN.
And the Duke was in the praetorium passing sentences of judgement upon the soldiers for the sake of the Name of the Christ
and he commanded that Apa Victor should be guarded in prison until the following day.
And on the morrow, when the Count was seated on the judgement throne, in the midst of the market-place of Rakote,
he gave orders, saying
Bring to me this Profane man Apa Victor, who hath been banished hither, and concerning whom the Emperors letter hath already been read to me.
And when they had brought Victor before the Count, he said unto him
Wilt thou not read the letter which concerneth my patient endurance again?
(If thou wilt) thou wilt find stated in it that I have been banished to this Place for the sake of this Name (of Christ, for they) said, 'Offer sacrifice (to Apollo)'; because I will not offer up sacrifice (I have been brought here)
The Duke said unto him
O bad head! Wouldst thou make a mock of me?
By the health of Apollo, this is thy punishment: we are to destroy thy body by fire. Knowest thou not that it is the emperor who hath commanded me what I am to do unto thee?
He hath commanded me to cast thee into the furnace of the baths
but I would shew mercy unto thee for the sake of thy father
And Apa Victor spake unto the Duke, saying
Yesterday thou didst disgrace my father ; do not disgrace him to-day. And moreover, (in spite of what) thou sayest
I will make bold and will speak in thy presence, according to this world.
In times past, before I was delivered over unto thee, I received rations and money (from the emperor)
Thou didst make supplication to my father, saying
Make me Count of Rakote.
And my father did not consider thee of sufficient honour for the position, and would not discuss the matter with thee. Then thou didst make entreaty to me secretly, and didst say
Speak to thy father on my behalf. Let him take from me three centenarii of gold, and give me the office of Count.
And I took thee into my house, and I made all my slaves to wait upon thee, and they received gifts of gold armlets (from thee). And after these things my father came in
and I threw myself on my knees before him on the ground, and I remained there until he was persuaded by me, and he made thee a Count.
And yet thou didst not keep in mind any one of these things for which thou canst now repay me. But it is written in the Gospel
He who did eat of my bread with me hath lifted up his heel against me.'
And the Duke made (his men) to inflict gashes in the face of Apa Victor, and he made them to stretch him out with thongs (of leather)
and they gave unto him fourteen stripes with the triple flogging whips, saying
I will torture thee until thou diest, according to the orders of the Emperor.
Afterwards the Duke made his man to drive iron nails into his hands and feet
and he covered (?) his whole body with iron, from his head to his feet
and he cast him into prison, where they abandoned him to hunger and thirst until the following day.
And when the morning was come the Count made them bring Apa Victor unto him, and when he bad been brought into his presence every part of him was loaded with iron (fetters).
 And the blessed man Apa Victor was not able to walk because of the weight of the iron which had been placed on his body
and the soldiers supplied twelve (men and) they carried him.
And the angels shall rejoice over thee, and Jesus shall exult upon His throne, and all the saints shall be glad with thee
This matter hath, however, taken place through the dispensation of God.
and now, behold, God hath fulfilled for me my wish this day.'
And I said unto him, 'My brother, is there any other brother beyond thee in the desert?'
There is nothing beyond me except darkness and the punishments which sinners are enduring.
 Sit thou down in this place, O my brother, in this hour, and thou shalt see mighty wonders.'
And when the light of the Lord's Day had spread abroad
I heard voices crying out, ' Thy love is accepted, O Christ; Thou hast shewn mercy unto us.'
And I said unto him, ' My beloved father, what shall we do in respect of these things?
The mountain is crumbling away under us.'
And he said unto me, ' Be not afraid, O my son, that God will come down for the sake of punishments.
He hath commanded the angels who inflict punishments upon souls to give them a respite, for to-day is the Lord's Day, and [the day of] the Resurrection of the Lord.'
And he also said unto me, ' Peradventure the Christ will come into this place to-day according to His wont, and I shall be able to kiss Him, mouth to mouth.'
And whilst he was saying these things, behold, the Christ opened the door of the habitation, and He came in; now the a door opened straightway of its own accord.
And when He had come in, believe me, O my brethren and fathers, I, Pambo, the least of men, saw the Christ go up to that brother and kiss him, mouth to mouth, even as doth a brother who hath arrived from a strange region when he meeteth his friend.
And as for me, Pambo, the least of men, I was not worthy that He should kiss me then, and He went forth from our midst and we did not know whither He had gone.
If this be so shew me now who this brother monk was Who came in and kissed thee, I myself being unworthy that He should kiss me.'
And he said unto me, 'Didst thou not know who He was?'
And I said unto him, 'No, my father, I did not. How should I know who He was?'
And he said unto me, 'This was the Lord of the thing's that are in heaven, and of the things that are upon the earth.
This was the Son of Mary, the Holy Virgin.
This was He Who filleth the desert, and every one who calleth upon Him.'
And he also said unto me, 'A great prophet and Archimandrite hath died this day, that is to say, Apa Shenoute the elder
Ⲧhe whole world is punished this day, for he was a very great teacher, and this day is the seventh of the month Epeph.'
And he also said unto me, 'This is the man who did not lie down on his bed, nor slumber, nor sleep until he found the place of the Lord, the habitation of the God of Jacob, his Helper.
Inasmuch as he fought splendidly he conquered the Devil in [this] world and hath departed to his Lord, and he shall be perfect in the kingdom which is in the heavens.
May his blessing and his prayer be with us! Amen.'
And he also said unto me, ‘My beloved brother Pambo, I am sick this day. I beseech thee to do me the favour of praying for me until I journey over the road of fear and terror.'
And I said unto him, 'My beloved father, art thou, even thou, afraid, notwithstanding all the multitude of ascetic labours which thou hast performed in this world?'
He said unto me, 'I have performed a few of the ascetic labours which God appointed for me, it is true, but how is it possible for us not to be afraid of the things which have been indicated to us by very many witnesses, that is to say, the river of fire, and the appearance before the Judge?
And it came to pass that at the third hour of the eighth day of the month Epeph he became very ill indeed, and he said unto me, 'I salute thee in the Lord, O my beloved brother.'
and he said unto me, 'I salute thee in the Lord, O my beloved brother.' And thus saying he prayed, and he recited the prayer in the Gospel, and he opened his mouth, and yielded up his spirit, like one who lieth asleep.
And I sat down, and I wept continuously over him. And as I was weeping over him, behold, the Christ opened the door of the cell, and He came in, and He stood up by the body of the blessed Apa Cyrus, and He wept over him and I wept over him.
And I saw the tears of the Christ which fell upon the body of the blessed Apa Cyrus; and the Christ turned away and departed by the door of the abode.
And when He had gone out I saw a multitude of Angels, and Archangels, and Apostles, and all the righteous, standing there.
And one of them came towards me ; now he was lame
and he said unto me, ' Knowest thou who I am?'
And I said unto him, ' Nay, my lord, I do not.' He said unto me, ' Hearken, [and] I will shew thee.
I am Kepha, unto whom they gave the name of Peter.
I am he whom the Christ called in the Gospel 'Bar lona,' that is to say, 'Son of the dove.'
The blessed Apa Shenoute went to his rest yesterday.
He, i.e. Christ, hath taken the soul of the blessed man Apa Cyrus, and [the soul of] Apa Shenoute, the Archimandrite, to the place of rest, even as it is written, 'There are many mansions in the house of My Father.'
And after these things, whilst I was pondering in my heart and trying to think what I should do with the body of the blessed man, and whether I should bury it, and where I should lay it, the Saviour came forth from the door of the cell, and closed the door behind Him.
And the Saviour had His hand upon the door of the cell
and He was dragging the body of the blessed man
and He became unto him a place of defence until the day of the Righteous Judgement.
And the Saviour went up into heaven with His angels.
And I walked and came forth to the brethren Apa Pamoun and Apa Hierax, and I told them of the things which I had seen, and they glorified God.
And I remained with them for a few days.
After these things I departed to my monastery in Shiet, and I wrote the life of the blessed man Apa Cyrus
and I placed it in the church of Shiet, for the profit and consolation of those who should hear it [read], and to the glory of the Holy Trinity, the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever! Amen.
And the duke answered,
And he said to her, 'Offer up sacrifice now, O Stephanou,'
and do not die an evil death.
And she said unto him, 'My name is indeed Stephanou, the interpretation of which is 'crown incorruptible,'
and therefore I will not offer up sacrifice, because I wish to receive the crown which is (indicated by) my name.
Then the duke was exceedingly wroth,
and he commanded his soldiers to set her between two palm-trees, and to tie her to each of them.
And they pulled the trunks of the two palms close to her holy body by means of a rope, and tied them together.
And afterwards the two palms were released suddenly by cutting the rope, and in this way she was rent asunder down to the middle of her body, and she became two pieces.
Thus she fulfilled her martyrdom in peace,
and she departed into the heavens, unto Him whom she had loved, the Christ, in great glory, amen.
Then the Duke passed the sentence of death upon Apa Victor, [and ordered his soldiers to] cut off his head.
And the blessed man Apa Victor answered and said unto him, 'I give thanks unto my Lord Jesus the Christ, Who hath given unto me these riches forever.
Now, therefore, hearken unto me, and I will declare unto you the following things which have been revealed to me.
Now after I am dead ye yourselves shall also die, at the end of my eleventh [year].
'And as concerning the Duke Sebastianos, an ekstasis shall take place, and certain men in a town shall delay [in paying tribute], and he shall embark in his boat and depart to despoil them,
and as (the crew) are tying the boat up to the bank, the Duke shall come forth.
And as he is coming down from the boat by the landing plank he shall trip up, and the monobolis shall penetrate his foot, and the foot shall mortify, and he shall die in the twenty-fourth year after my death.
And again, all the wise men and all the orators shall go and eat their midday meal together at the end of the eighth year after my death, and the house wherein they are shall fall upon them, and they shall all die together.
And Apa Victor said unto the executioner, 'Dismiss me speedily, for the sake of the angels who have hold upon me.'
Now the executioner was not pleased to do so, for he only struck his neck with the sword,
And his head hung by the skin of his neck.
And Apa Victor was in torture, and his spirit was sorely distressed in him.
And he looked up and saw Horian the Kourson,
and he said unto him, 'Take the sword out of the hand of this lawless man, and do thou make an end of me, for this wicked man of Sioout hath already done very many evil thinks to me during my lifetime, and now also at my death he doth grievously afflict my spirit.
May the Lord reward him according to what he hath done unto me.'
And Horion placed his napkin before his face.
And (Apa Victor) said unto him, 'O my beloved brother, I entreat thee most earnestly,'
and (Horion) girded on the sword.
And the camp was shaken three times.
Then he cut off his head.
He consummated his martyrdom.
And Horion lifted up his eyes to heaven.
and he saw the soul of Apa Victor, which Ausouel carried (to heaven) in a napkin made of byssus,
and the saints saluted the soul of Apa Victor.
And when they had taken off the head of Apa Victor blood mingled with milk came forth.
And he consummated his glorious martyrdom on the twenty-seventh day of the month Parmoute, at the tenth hour of the day.
And all the words which he spake before they took off his head came true.
Peace be upon every one who hath suffered martyrdom for the Name of our Lord Jesus the Christ, to Whom be the glory, and to His Good Farther, and to the Holy Spirit, life-giving and consubstantial, now and always, forever and ever, amen.
Agree thou therefore with him that goeth to law with thee whilst he is with thee in the way;
for when the way hath come to an end, thou wilt no longer find another opportunity for repentance.
Watch thou then carefully lest he that goeth to law with thee give thee over into the hand of the Judge, and the Judge give thee over into the hand of the attendant, that is to say, the merciless powers which are over the punishments, and they cast thee into prison, that is to say, the outer darkness, until thou pay the uttermost kontrantes
Moreover, they shall judge thee not only for thy deeds, but also for thy thoughts and for thy motives.
Since, therefore, we know all these things, let us help ourselves.
When we shall have actual expei'ience of the punishments, then we shall know that bitter is pleasure, and then we shall have good reason for knowing how bitter that bitterness can be.
Now therefore, since these things take place in this wise, O my beloved, let us make our appeal to the Merciful God not to deliver us over into the hands of the demons.
and it is they who shall be our accusers in the Day of Judgement.
Let us, then, be afraid in our hearts of that day, and of that hour wherein our own power of reasoning shall be our sternest judge, and of that moment wherein we shall see them (i. e., our sins) all standing before us, clearly depicted in our sight, as if they were actual images,
(Now) we ourselves love a certain man for (one) of three things ; either because of his goodness, or because he loveth us ourselves, or because of his beauty.
But what other kind of beauty is there which can be compared with that which belongeth to our God?
even as David spake saying, 'He is fairer in His beauty than the children of men'
Moreover, who is there who hath loved us as our God and Father hath loved us?
Consider now the blessed man David and how great was the | desire which he had to see God, for he said, 'When shall I come and appear before the face of my God?
He did not wish to wait until the appointed time in his life, but he burned with desire to come forth from this place (or, world), and to see Him Whom he loved.
Such desire or such readiness appertained to the soul of the philosopher, which took to itself wings and flew up into the sky.
Moreover, thou thyself shalt love this (God) only, and thou shalt pass by all the works (or, affairs) of this life as if they were shadows.
Keep thou in remembrance at all times the life which shall be for ever,
and the kingdom which shall endure, and the existence with the choirs of angels, and the imperishable glory, and the living of the life with Christ, wherein there shall be no sorrow of heart whatsoever, for the Scripture saith, 'Sorrow of heart, and grief, and sighing, shall flee away.'
And continue to remember this life wherein there is nothing but grief, and weeping, and sadness of heart, and contumely, and carelessness, and sin, and suffering , and old age, and death.
and he earnestly desired to escape from all these (troubles).
And he said, ' When shall I come and appear before the face of my God?'
, so that thou thyself mayest hear (the words), 'Enter into the' joy of our God.'
It is right therefore for us to keep watch, and to pray at all times.
Similarly also the husbandman is accustomed to keep watch throughout the night, so that no person may destroy his vineyard, and the shepherd also keepeth watch all night guarding his flocks of sheep,
Even as the Patriarch Jacob spake saying, 'I was consumed by the fiery heat in the daytime, and by the cold of the night, and sleep departed from my eyes.'
And for what reason did he pass such long nights of vigil ? He did so because he said, f Peradventure some wild beast will destroy one of the sheep/
and it is the soul which they will place before the Awful Throne, and make to defend itself for all that it hath done.
for it is unlikely that we shall be able to repent in that place (i. e., in the world to come).
For this same reason we shall be condemned to come forth from the body (which shall) be hidden from us, in order that we may be in terror at all times.
And consider the blessed man Jacob who, having set a stone under his head, slept and saw a ladder upon the earth, the top whereof reached up into the sky;
and the angels of God were ascending and descending on it,
and they were bearing our prayers up to God, and bringing to us blessings from His hand.
If they have joy concerning us when we repent, in like manner they must be sorrowful in heart concerning our carelessness.
For at all times our conscience accuseth us, and chideth us for what we have done, more especially when we speak concerning the judgement which is to come ;
Would that that rich man had been rebuked (on earth), for then his tongue would not have been consumed in the fire which cannot be extinguished!
And if thou shalt say when thou prayest, ' Keep me, O God, as the apple of (Thine) eye,' He Himself shall say unto thee, 'Keep thou My words and My commandments as the apple of (thine) eye
And, O beloved, now that thou hast set thy hand to the plough, do not turn back, and thou shalt not become like a pillar of salt.
Let neither anger have dominion over thee, nor grief, nor any feeling of passion whatsoever; and utter not vain words without consideration.
and thy speech shall be according to the Law of God.
Set thou the Giver of the Law before thine eyes at all times, and let Him continue to abide with thee, and let Him be unto thee a counsellor.
Let him fare delicately in his eatings and feastings, but do thou (nourish) thyself on the words of God.
 but also that thou mayest have rule over pride and wrath.
and take heed that thou dost not make thy conscience to pass sentence upon thee before the condemnation (or, judgement).
Remember thou that of necessity all our works shall be made manifest.
No man desireth that even one person shall see us in this world if we are to be put to shame;
and 'the righteous man declareth the faith which is manifest
Remember thou at all times the good confession of Christ which hath entered into thy heart. Remember thou the last day. Make thou thyself secure on every side, especially in the matter of thy tongue,
for the Scripture saith, ' The tongue is that which polluteth the whole body '; when the body is polluted it is a necessity that the heart also should be corrupt therewith.
Therefore well hath Paul said, Men whose hearts are evil and ' evil words corrupt the hearts which are good
Seek thou after Paul, even as did the blessed woman Thekla, so that thou mayest hear the words of Paul.
Let thine eyes look downwards upon the ground, but let thy heart be in the height of the heavens.
Thou hast need of great soberness (or, caution), for thine Adversary standeth against thee, and he is wary.
He was cast forth from the Paradise which was upon the earth, and he seeth thee now (as) thou enterest into heaven, and is not unmindful of it.
Hearken unto the word of him that saith, 'I wish that ye may be without care.'
Let there be no care whatsoever to thee about anything, except only that which concerneth the kingdom which is in the heavens.
If thou wishest to enter into heaven with the body, from the earth, subdue thou the flesh by means of fasting, and then thou shalt be able to make it to enter into the height with ease.
Lift up thine eyes to the heavens, wherein is He Whom thou lovest, and thou shalt overcome passion by means of the love which is holy.
Prayer and faith shall help thee, and the Holy Scriptures shall give thee instruction, and thou shalt have from this world, according to (His) pledge to us, the rest which is in the heavens.
Abide not with a woman who shall make thee to offend, have no care for a child, and avoid thou the care which appertaineth to the rearing of a child.
Follow thou after thy God Who shall be the guide of thy heart into the kingdom which is in the heavens.
Follow thou after Him Who saith unto thee, ' If ye shall come to l Me in rectitude, I Myself will come to you in rectitude.
If thou wishest to be like unto Christ, follow thou in His footsteps ;
narrow is the gate and difficult, and it is (only) the righteous who enter in through it.
Hearken unto the blessed man Daniel, who saith, ' I Daniel was in sore grief for three weeks.
And John who dwelt in the desert did not cultivate a vineyard for himself, in order that he might not make himself to be a being attached to the earth.
Let these be unto thee (examples) which have been prepared to instruct thee.
Thou shalt choose for thyself the citizenship which appertaineth. to heaven.
Fight thou the good fight of faith,6 and look eagerly beyond it to thy crown of righteousness,
and let thy career be strenuous.
It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God
 Hast thou not observed the statues of the emperors, and noticed that some of them are large and beautifully adorned,
whilst others have become black through (the lapse of) time, and have decayed, and have become objects of derision?
Thus shall all our works appear in that other world which is to come, even as the statues.
Let us flee from that shame which shall be for ever,
For He hath no need whatsoever of anything that belongeth to us, except only the salvation of our souls.
for He spake saying, 'He that shall endure patiently to the end shall be saved'
And again (the Book saith), He hath suffered for ever, he shall live to the I end.'
let us run wisely so that we may obtain, even as it is written.
and calmness of mind and body, and temperance in eating, and the continence which is effective, and the love of strenuous toil, and sympathy, and brotherly love, and the sharing of our possessions with our neighbours, and the faith which is perfect.
Now these are only a very few (of the qualities) of which we may make mention in this case, and they need great striving to make them to flourish.
It doth not say that it is like unto the sun, or the moon, or the beautiful hosts of the stars, or the gold which is incorruptible, or the beauty which fadeth away, or even the sky itself.
Observe the exalted reputation of purity, for it entereth into everything.
Therefore what is seemly for us to do is to pray, so that those who are strong among the virgins may remain permanent in their healthy state,
and that those who are sick, who have actually fallen into sin, may receive healing.
Now it is seemly that we ourselves should weep in such a manner that we may wash out our eyes which have been seeing badly ;
thou seest the wound, and thou knowest what will heal it.
Fortify thou the windows of thy soul, and not only thine ears, and thine eyes, and thy mouth,
for these are the entrances through which the Evil One is wont to come in, even as it is written, 'Death hath entered in through your windows'
Let the commandments of holiness be upon thine eyes, and upon thine ears.
Let the Psalms be in thy mouth, and meditation on the Scriptures [in thy heart].
Therefore it is seemly for us to open our windows, that is to say, our senses (or, feelings) to God, and to shut them fast against the Adversary.
Take thou, however, good heed unto thyself, lest there be thorns in the palm tree, that is to say, admonishings, when thou art driven to follow after sin,
for the Book saith, ' The words of the wise are as ox-goads, and as the nails which are sharp '—so that whilst these remain fixed in thy heart thou shalt abstain from every sin.
Now the Book saith, ' Lay hold upon the height thereof/ in order that thou mayest be above the sky, and be able to bear the temptations which shall come upon thee.
From time to time, and at all times, rehearse the Holy | Scriptures,
for as the wine which men drink assuageth grief, and changeth the sadness of the heart into joy, even so doth the spiritual wine which is distributed throughout the Scriptures make the soul which hath partaken thereof to rejoice.
Let the remembrance of God be in thy heart at all times, and thou thyself shalt say with David, I see God face to face at all times ; He is on (my) right hand, therefore shall I never be moved
Let these words be written on thy hands, and fixed firmly before thine eyes.
If thou wilt ascribe glory to God by reason of His commandments, He shall be on thy right hand;
if thou treat Him with contempt through thy transgressions, the Devil shall be on thy right hand.
For thus doth the Scripture bear witness concerning Judas who made himself to be an assistant (of the Devil): ' Let the Devil stand on his right hand'
Ascribe thou glory unto God at all times, and say, I will exalt Thee, O my God and King'';
thou shalt glorify Him through thy works, and not through thy words only.
In this wise did David ascribe glory to God, and he said, ' I will bless Thee for ever, and for ever and ever (He did not glorify Him) for a day, neither for a month, nor for a year, but throughout his life,
for he well knew that if a man made perfect his glorification of God he would be only beginning.
But thou wilt say often, ' What manner of heart is it that is able to ascribe glory to God at all times?
And again, it is even as David spake saying, ' Cleanse me, O God, from my secret (sins)
And our heart must be like unto that which the Saviour commanded us to make for ourselves saying, Blessed are those who are pure in their hearts, for they shall see God
Thus is it with the man who committeth no sin against God,
he shall not fall into despair, but he shall say with Paul, ' Who shall separate us from the love of God ?' and the words which follow these.
and that moment when we shall take our stand before the Holy Throne, and shall have to defend every deed which we have done in this world, and when all the sins which we have committed shall be made to appear before the eyes of every one,
Then shall all the works which we have done be laid bare, those which we have done openly, and those which we have done in secret, and the things which have been done in the night season, and those which have been done in the daytime, and those which we have done inadvertently, and the faults of forgetfulness
and those which we have done with the members in the body, and those which we have performed at the dictates of our hearts ;
and in that hour everything which we have done during our whole lives, and every sin which we committed in secret, shall be revealed.
Remember that it is necessary for us to transfer ourselves from this world, and that we must appear before the Judge Whom it is impossible to deceive,
Who shall reveal the things which are hidden in the darkness, Who shall make manifest the counsels of hearts, and Who shall try our works, and our l thoughts, and our words.
In (that) hour we shall receive a great punishment for the sins which we have committed, and which we imagined were few.
Keep thou in thy remembrance at every hour the flame of Gehenna which cannot be quenched, and forget it not.
And set thou at all times before thine eyes the Judge, Who shall come to judge those who are living and those who are dead.
Think, moreover, of the thousands of thousands, and the tens of thousands of tens of thousands, of angels who stand before the Judge at all times.
Let thine ears hear beforehand the sound of the trumpets, and the awful voice of that Judge,
and let thine eyes see beforehand the things which are ordained to take place.
Now there shall be some whom they will cast forth into the outer darkness,
and there are others who even after the fight, and the suffering, which (they have endured for the sake of) virginity, shall have the door of the bridal chamber, which is in the heavens, shut against them.
Look at certain of them, and observe how they are tied up in bundles, like garden waste, and cast into the furnace of fire.
On one they pass the sentence of condemnation because he laughed the laugh of the scoffer, and out of season
and on another because he offended his brother, or because he Fol. 48 b col. 1 behaved | unjustly towards his neighbour;
To another they assign retribution because of the idle words which he spake.
On another they pass sentence of doom because of his evil mind.
In the face (or, mouth) of another the door of the kingdom is shut because of the words of infamy which he hath spoken.
Another they deliver over to derision and shame for ever.
And others who have shewn themselves to be entirely destitute of the understanding of God shall hear (spoken the words), 'I know you not; whence are ye?
because they did in the course of their works things which were an abomination to Christ.
Let us cry out to the mercy of God, so long as we are in this habitation,
for the Scripture saith, 'Who shall give thanks unto Thee in Amente?'
Moreover, let us consider this, O beloved. God hath made for us all the members of our material body double,
for He hath bestowed upon us two eyes, two ears, two hands, and two feet.
If it should happen that one of these (pairs) becometh disabled through sickness, we are able to relieve our wants by (using) the other.
The soul, however, which hath been made for us is one only, and if we destroy it through carelessness, by what manner of means shall we live?
Let us take exceedingly great care that we do not permit anything whatsoever to become of more importance than the health of the soul, for it is the soul which will be set up to be judged, and it is the soul which will have to defend (the body) before that Throne.
If thou shalt say at that time to the Judge, ' The possessions of this world outwitted me'
He 'Who judgeth shall make answer unto thee saying, Didst thou then not hear Me when I cried out to thee, In what shall a man be benefited if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his soul?'
Or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?
And He shall say unto thee, moreover, ' Eve profited nothing when she said, 'The serpent deceived me.'
Further, O my brethren, let us set these things in our hearts.
Come ye, let us rise up of ourselves with glad readiness.
Come ye, let us ascribe glory to God, before the darkness cometh, and before there cometh upon us that great and shining day,
concerning which the Prophet spake saying, ' Behold, God cometh!
Who shall be able to abide the day in which He cometh?
That day shall be a day of terror, a day of darkness and blackness, a day of cloud and gloom, a day of blasts of the trumpet.
Peradventure thou wilt say, 'Who shall be able to escape all these things?'
Hearken, it is I who will tell thee.
Now thou must not imagine that thou wilt escape merely by keeping thy body in a state of purity; on the contrary (these things also must thou do).
Whensoever any man doeth unto thee that which is evil thou must do unto him that which is good in return.
Whensoever men make false accusations against thee thou must continue to lead a well-ordered life.
Whensoever men curse (or, revile) thee, thou must bless them in return.
Whensoever thou shalt fast thou shalt not be puffed up thereby, for it is not thine abstinence from eating only which is true fasting, but also thine abstinence from sin.
It is meet for us to search carefully the Scriptures.
For observe that it was a staff of wood of the almond tree which the prophet saw at the beginning,
but afterwards it was a brazen vessel of fire which actually appeared to him, which indicated that he who will not lay hold on the rod
Moreover, in this same manner did Moses teach the people, with a pillar of light and a pillar of fire. He cried out unto every one saying-, He who will hearken to the Law shall have the enjoyment of the light which is true and pleasant, and he who will not hearken shall be delivered over to the fire.'
Read ye the Gospels, and ye shall know that when we shall go forth from this world there is nothing whatsoever which will help us.
No brother shall be able to set free (another) brother from the punishment which never endeth, and no friend shall be able to help his friend;
neither shall fathers be able to help their children, nor children their fathers.
But why should I speak of ordinary men in this manner?
For neither Noah, nor Daniel, nor Job, would be able to set free either son or daughter.
Now many times thou wilt say to me, 'What is the proof of these words?
(I will tell thee.) Consider the man who had not on him the wedding garment, and observe that, after they had cast him forth from the bridal chamber,
Consider, moreover, the five virgins, and observe that after the door of the bridal chamber had been shut in their faces (or, mouths),
none of their fellow-virgins asked the bridegroom for a recompense for those whom Christ called foolish
and those who are on (His) left He Himself casteth forth into the outer darkness, and none of those who are on the right hand is able to help them.
Verily, true is that proverb which saith, ' Behold the man and his work'
Behold, hast thou not heard concerning that rich man, between whom and Lazarus a gulf had been made, who wished him to sprinkle water (on his tongue) as he was burning in the place of punishment?
And thou sawest also that Abraham was not able to set the rich man free from the place of punishment, although the rich man entreated him (to do so).
Ought we not, then, to help ourselves in this world, and to ascribe glory to God before the darkness cometh, that is to say, before we are banished into the darkness?
It is far better to have our tongue parched in this world by fasting than for us to wish to have water sprinkled (upon it) in that place where water will not be given unto us.
Let us put forth our utmost endeavour to free ourselves from this great torture through a few sufferings in this world.
Remember when the fever of sickness cometh upon us, or a few disasters (or, calamities), or when we look upon those who are punished by the judge in (this) world, whereupon horror and quaking seize upon us, notwithstanding the fact that both the punishment and the place of judgement (endure) only for a very short space of time, remember,
I say, what manner of punishment it shall be in the place of jiidgement in the Other World which is to come, wherein we shall be punished for endless ages.
For sickness bringeth to nought the strength of the body, and even the beauty of the bodily form decayeth through old age.
And in short, everything which is in this world becometh like unto the web of the spider, and like unto dreams.
Rightly, therefore, did the Saviour ascribe blessing to those who afflict themselves so that the pleasures of this world may not prevail over them.
And let us pray with the holy man David, and say unto God, ' I will bless Thee seven times in the day because of the judgement of Thy righteousness'
If the friendship of a good man converteth him that meeteth with him to that which is excellent, how much more will he be benefited who holdeth converse with God, by night and by day, by means of prayer?
Ponder beforehand upon the death which thou shalt die in thy members which are upon the earth, and (remember) that the day of God shall come like a thief.
When those who are to bear away thy soul shall come after thee thou wilt say, ' Be merciful unto me, for I will fast, I will do deeds of mercy, I will repent.'
And they shall say unto thee, c Didst thou, then, not hear God Who cried out saying, 'The kingdom which is in the heavens hath drawn nigh?'
Didst thou, then, not hear Paul saying, 'Whilst we have time with us let us do the thing which is good?'
He who desireth salvation hath no need of a long time [for repentance].
The thief had no need of a long time for repentance; he believed earnestly, and he gained Paradise.
Moreover, we see physicians inflicting pain on men, and we also see the governors who sit on the seat of judgement inflicting righteous punishments on the thieves, and this they do in order that through the sufferings of others we may be admonished.
And now, O my beloved, since we are rooted in the faith, let us increase in knowledge ; from knowledge (let us proceed) to love, and from this to the inheritance which is in the heavens.
Let us persist obstinately in prayer, as it is written.
or this reason is it good that we should continue to exercise ourselves in our work at all times, and even if no temptations come upon us, the exercise will certainly do thee no harm whatsoever, nay, on the contrary, thou wilt benefit thyself exceedingly.
Therefore it is meet for us to keep watch on every side, so that evil may not break into our souls.
When once the soul hath tasted sin, it will continue in a state of unconsciousness, and will go on adding greatly to the sickness of sin.
For this reason what we ought to do is to drive back once and for all the beginnings of sin, just as we should drive back a horse which is uncontrolled.
For the works of men are in no wise different from dreams and shadows, and they are like the rushing torrent which floweth swiftly away.
Hold not to be marvellous things the possessions and the riches of this world, but observe how they are transferred from this man to that, and how they pass from that man to another
for this reason it is right that we should despise them.
For very right is the word which is written that saith, ' The things which are seen are those that are for a time, whilst the things which are not seen are those which are for ever'
The latter things are incorruptible and indestructible, and they abide without change.
Let us therefore do our utmost to acquire these things for ourselves.
Let us strive eagerly for these things, for otherwise it is unlikely that we shall be able to acquire any of these for ourselves, when we shall go forth from this life.
For he who striveth in the contest receiveth not the crown if he abandoneth the contest; therefore let us seize and carry off the crown, and we shall thus escape disgrace and loss.
Now the Scripture saith, 'He whose possessions are consumed with fire shall suffer loss'
Now what kind of burning with fire is that which shall be to us?
And what kind of thing is the outer darkness?
And what kind of things are the place of Weeping and the gnashing of teeth?
Take these things into thy heart, and guard thou thy soul and keep in virgin state until the Bridegroom cometh in His glory.
And do thou sing psalms saying, ' My soul is in thy hands at all times' I do not forget Thy Law.'
And say, 'Thou art He Who doth deliver me from the snare of the hunter.'
Let thy lamp be burning, and permit not thyself to fall asleep.
And if slumber be sweet to thee in the night season, yet know thou that there is nothing sweeter than the Psalms.
For the holy man (David) said, 'Thy words are sweeter in my throat than honey in the mouth.'
The martyrs gave their own souls for the Name of God
let us bring as an offering (to Him) our life of self-denial.
Remember that some of the martyrs were laid upon coals of fire :
Although thou mayest weep occasionally for thy sins, thou hast not as yet done as Paul did, who wept for the salvation of others.
Vanquish suffering by means of hope.
For the Scripture saith, ' Tribulation worketh patience, and patience hope, and hope giveth birth to shamefacedness.'
Consider, moreover, that pleasure (endureth) only for a short time, and that punishment lasteth for ever.
For thou knowest that, after the people (of Israel) had passed over the sea, without being drowned, Moses himself became master of the land through the appetite of the belly.
Lay fast hold, therefore, at all times upon these teachings which are full of salvation, and keep thou them, and fulfil thou them, so that the Holy Trinity may be glorified through thee, Father, and Son, and Holy Spirit, henceforward, and always, for all ages of ages. Amen.
But where shall those who are living in the desert, for God's sake, find a man if trouble come upon them?
If they are hungry where can they find food?
If they are thirsty where can they find water to drink?
When they begin to lead the life of the anchorite they rejoice exceedingly because of hunger, and thirst, and the excellence of their manner of life.
And the Adversary who fighteth with them to tempt them thereby doth not wish them to continue the life of the anchorite, for he knoweth that the reward is great which they will receive from God when they shall come forth from the body.
When they are preaching ascetic labours the compassion of God cometh upon them, and He maketh the angels to serve them in respect of their food, and He bringeth for them water out of the rock.
For it is written in Isaiah, Those who abide patiently in the Lord shall renew their strength.
They shall spread out their wings like the eagles in flight.
They shall fly away and shall not fall.
They shall journey and shall not suffer hunger.
He saith, Water shall be brought to them out of the rock.
When they suffer hunger He will make the grass which is in the field to be sweet to their mouths, even as honey is sweet.
If tribulation come upon them, or danger rise up against them, straightway they spread out their hands and they pray to the King Jesus until there cometh to them speedily His help which He sendeth forth, and straightway He strengtheneth them because of the integrity of their heart in respect to Him.
Hast thou never heard that which is written, The Lord will not forsake His people, and the patient endurance of the miserable man shall not fail utterly?
And again, the poor man crieth out,
and the Lord heareth him,
and delivereth him in all his tribulations.
The Lord giveth unto every man according to what he hath suffered.
Blessed is the man who shall do the will of God upon the earth!
I say unto thee that the angels shall serve him from the time when he entereth the body, and they shall comfort him at all times in his need.
And to me, your brother, when I had heard these things from these perfect men of God, they became like unto honey, which is sweet in my belly,
and a mighty ecstasy took place within me,
and I became like unto those whose minds are carried away into another world.
And I rose up straightway,
and I took a few bread cakes with me, sufficient for the four days' journey, so that I might eat of them until I arrived at the place which God should appoint for me.
``And when I had come forth from the monastery I looked,
and I saw a being of light before me,
and I was afraid,
and I thought in my mind that I would turn back to the place to which I came first of all, and remain there(?).
And when he knew that I was afraid, he said unto me, `Fear not,
for I am the angel that dwelleth with thee, and that hath travelled with thee from thy childhood;
this stewardship, which the Lord hath appointed to thee, thou shalt be able to fulfil.'
``And when I had come into the mountain, and I had journeyed in the desert for six or seven miles,
I saw a cave,
and I turned towards it, for I saw that there was a man inside it.
And a very great saint of God came out to me; now this form (or, behaviour) was goodly, and there was a fine graciousness over his countenance.
And when I had seen him, I made obeisance unto him.
And he raised me up,
and he saluted me,
and he said unto me, `Thou art Onnophrios, my fellow worker in the Lord;
Come in.
The Lord be with thee. Thou shalt succeed in the good work whereunto He hath invited thee.'
And I went inside,
and I sat down there with him for a few days,
and I learned the rules of the doctrine of God from him,
and he taught me the regulations which governed the life of the monk in the desert.
And when he saw that I was acquainted with the hidden and terrible fighting which existed in the desert, he said unto me, `Rise up, my son, and let me take thee to a desolate place in the inner desert, and thou shalt abide therein by thyself for God's sake.
Since God hath appointed thee to this work thou must dwell in the desert.
And straightway he rose up, and journeyed with me into the desert for a distance of four days' journey,
and at the end of the four days we came to a small hut,
And he said unto me, 'This is the place which the Lord hath appointed thee to live in.'
And he sat down with me for a month of days, until I understood the good work which it was meet for me to do.
And afterwards he departed from me,
and we never saw each other again until this year when I saw him once on the day whereon he laid down the body,
and I buried him inside the place wherein he was.''
And I (i.e. Papnoute) said unto him, ``My good and beloved father, at the beginning, when thou didst first come to this place, didst thou suffer from the weather?''
And the blessed old man said unto me, ``I suffered greatly on several occasions from hunger, and thirst, and the heat outside in the daytime, and the great cold by night,
and my flesh was wasted away by the dews of heaven.
And when God [saw] that I endured patiently in my good strife of fasting, and that I gave my heart to ascetic practices, He made holy angels serve me, and bring to me my daily food, and an angel gave it to me evening by evening, and he stood by my body.
For it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word which cometh forth from the mouth of God doth man live.
If thou doest the will of God, He shall take care of thee in every place.
For He hath said in the Holy Gospel, Take no care for what ye shall eat, or for what ye shall drink, or with what raiment ye shall clothe yourselves, for your Father Who is in heaven knoweth of what things ye have need without your asking Him.
Seek ye His kingdom and His righteousness,
and these things shall be added unto you.
And when I had heard these things I marvelled exceedingly, and I said unto him, ``O my holy father, where dost thou partake of the Sacrament on the Sabbath Day and on the First Day of the week?''
And he said unto me, ``O my holy father, an angel cometh and administereth to me the Sacrament on the Sabbath Day and on the First Day of the week.
And the angel cometh and administereth the Sacrament to every one who is in the desert,
and he giveth unto them consolation.
And, moreover, when they desire to see any one, they are taken up into the heights of heaven, and they see all the saints, and they salute them, and thereby their hearts receive light, and they rejoice, and are glad with God in those good things.
And when they see them they receive consolation, and they forget that they have suffered in any way; and afterwards they return to their bodies, and they continue to feel comforted for a very long time.
And when we had finished the prayer we gave (i.e. said) the 'Amen',
and we sat down together
and talked on about the majesty of God.
And at the time when the sun was about to set I looked
and I saw a loaf of bread and a vessel of water.
And he said unto me, ``Rise up, my brother, and eat, and drink this small quantity of water, for I see that thou art exhausted by hunger and thirst, and by the toil of the road.''
And I said unto him, ``As God Almighty liveth, I will neither eat nor drink unless we stretch ourselves out and eat the bread together.''
And he said unto me, 'O my son, may God not cause thee to grieve about any matter whatsoever, and may He strengthen thee in His love, so that thine eyes may receive the light of His Godhead, and so that thou mayest neither lean to one side nor fall, but mayest end successfully the work whereunto thou has set thy hand.
May the angels shelter thee, and deliver thee from the plottings of the Jews, and may no accusation fall upon thee when thou hast to meet God.'
And when he had made an end of saying these things he rose up,
and prayed to God with sighings and many tears;
and afterwards he laid himself upon the ground,
and he completed his stewardship in God, and yielded up his spirit into the hand of God on the sixteenth day of the month Paone.
And I heard the voices of the angels singing hymns before the blessed Apa Onnofrios, and there was great joy at his meeting God.
And I took off the garment wherewith I was clothed,
and tore it into two pieces; in the one I wrapped up [the holy man] for burial, and the other I used as raiment, so that I might not be naked.
And I placed his body down in a cleft in the rock,
and I heard the sounds of a multitude of angels rejoicing, and crying out, 'Alleluia;'
and I said my prayer over him, and I rolled several stones upon him.
And I stood up
and prayed the second time, and straightway the palm-tree fell down,
and I marvelled exceedingly at what had taken place;
and I ate what was left of the bread, and I drank of the water which was left to us.
And when I perceived that it was not according to the will of God for me to remain in this place, I spread out my hands,
and I prayed unto the Lord; and behold, the man who had come to me at the first, and who had given me strength, came to me again as he had done before.
And he said unto me, 'My God, our Lord, informed us this day that thou wast coming to us in this place.
Behold, for six years we have seen no man except thyself.'
And when we had talked together for a long time . . . . . .
. . . said unto him, ``O our brother, stablish thy heart with a little bread, for thou hast travelled from a place afar off.
The Lord hath ordained that we are to remain with each other for some days,
and we will rejoice with thee, O our beloved brother.''
And whilst we were talking to each other, behold, five loaves of bread were brought in, and they were warm and soft as if they had been [just] baked in the oven,
And whilst we were talking to each other, behold, five loaves of bread were brought in, and they were warm and soft as if they had been [just] baked in the oven,
 and we sat down and ate together.
And he said unto me, ``Behold, this is the sixth year since we came to this place,
and four loaves of bread have been allotted to us daily, and these came to us through God;
but as soon as thou didst come unto us this day, behold, a fifth loaf hath been brought for thee.
And we have never known whence they came, but when we came in we found them placed here.''
And when we had finished eating together we passed the whole night in praying, and we prayed till morning.
And when the morning had come I entreated them to let me remain with them until the day of my death.
And they said unto me, 'O our brother labourer, it is not ordained for thee to tarry in this place.
And when I had journeyed away from them for some days I came to a well of water,
and I sat down there for a little because of [my] fatigue; and large trees were growing by the well.
And when I had refreshed myself and had rested a little, I walked among the trees, and I marvelled,
and I said unto myself, ``Who was it that planted them in this place?''
And among them there were date-palms, loaded with fruit, and citron trees, and pomegranate trees, and fig trees, and apple trees, and vines, and dorakion trees, and kisma trees, and trees which emitted sweet odours.
And the well supplied water, and it watered all the trees which were growing in that place.
And whilst I was marvelling at the trees, and was looking at them, and at the fruit that was on them, behold four young men appeared in the distance, and their forms were goodly, and they were dressed in fine skin garments which, as it were, covered all their bodies.
And when they had come up to me they said unto me, ``Hail, thou man of God, O our beloved brother!''
And it came to pass that when the Saviour had risen from the dead, He came on to the Mount of Olives, and sat down. And He made a cloud to envelop all the countries wherein were the Apostles,
and it gathered them together into the presence of the Saviour upon the Mount of Olives.
And John answered and said unto the Saviour, ' My Lord,
behold Thou didst say unto me : Thou art My beloved one, and thou hast found grace before Me.
Then the Apostles became like unto dead men,
and they fell down upon the earth through fear;
But the Saviour took hold of their hands, and raised them up, and removed the fear from them, and stablished their hearts for them.
And John answered (and said), 'My Lord, explain to me the order of the Cherubim, which is exceedingly terrible.'
The Saviour made answer and said unto John,
 Hearken unto Me, and I will shew you everything.
Thou seest the Cherubim.
The words of the Father are hidden within him, from their beginning until their fulfilment.
Behold, I will make him to come to thee so that he may explain everything, O My beloved John.'
And the Saviour turned Himself towards the Cherubim, and He said unto him, 'I tell thee to take My beloved John into heaven.
And thou shalt explain unto him every question which he shall ask thee.'
If only men were to know of the supplications of Michael at the time when the water should come upon the earth, they would never commit sin at all.
However, Michael taketh with him twelve times ten thousand angels, and they go into the presence of the Father,
and they cast themselves down before Him,
and they do not rise up again until God sendeth the waters down upon the world.'
Then I answered and said unto the Cherubim, 'I have heard one say
that 'God created the heavens and the earth',
and again, that 'God created the waters from the beginning.'
 And the Cherubim, ‘Hearken, and I will inform thee concerning everything.
Before ever God created the heavens and the earth, water was in existence, and there is no one whatsoever who knoweth anything about the creation of water except God Himself.
For this reason whosoever shall take an oath which is false, in the name of water, shall never receive forgiveness.
And whosoever shall take an oath [which is false] by the wheat-plant,
[shall also never receive forgiveness, for], the same ordinance applieth to both the water and the wheat-plant.'
And I said to the Cherubim, ' My Lord, I wish that thou wouldst inform me concerning the matter of the wheat-plant, and tell me where, in the beginning, before the earth had been cultivated,
it was found that man might live upon it.'
The Cherubim said unto me, ' Hearken, and I will inform thee concerning everything.
Now it came to pass that God having created Adam placed him in the Paradise of joy, and He gave him a command saying thus: 'Of every tree which is in Paradise thou shalt eat, with the exception of the tree of the knowledge of that which is good and of that which is evil; of that thou shalt not eat. And on the day wherein thou shalt eat thereof thou shalt certainly die.'
Now the Devil was jealous of Adam when he saw with what great glory he was surrounded.
The Sun and the Moon, the two great luminaries, used to come daily and worship Adam before they rose above the earth.
And the Devil went and led astray Adam and his wife, until at length they were cast forth out fromParadise; and they were banished to the land of Eueilat,
where Adam lived a life of care and anxiety.
Now after all these things, Adam was an hungered, and he could not find food to eat similar to that which they were wont to eat daily in Paradise.
'And he cried out to the Lord in grief and in tribulation of heart.
And the Son of graciousness (or, goodness), Who acted as sponsor for him, had compassion upon him,
and He spake unto His Good Father, the Lord of the Angels and of the Spirits, saying, 'Behold, the man whom We have created in Our image and likeness is an hungered,
and I am sorrowful on his account, O My Father. Now, if it be Thy will, do not let him die before Thy face.' And in this wise did His Father of Compassion
answer and say unto His beloved Son, ' If it be that Thou art moved with compassion for the man whom We have created, and who hath cast [My] commandment behind him,
go Thou and give him Thy flesh and let him eat thereof, for it is Thou who hast undertaken to act as his advocate.'
And the Son of Goodness made answer and said unto His Father, 'Blessed be Thy word.
That which Thou hast said I will do.'
Then the beloved Son came forth from the presence of His Good Father,
and He took a little piece of His right side, of His divine flesh,
and He rubbed it down into small pieces, and brought it to His Holy Father.
Then His Father took out a portion of His own body, and He made it into a grain of wheat, and He brought forth the seal of light wherewith He set a seal upon the worlds of light, and He sealed the grain of wheat in the middle thereof.
And He said unto His beloved Son, ' Take this, and give Thou it unto Michael, the Archangel, and let him give it unto Adam, and let him tell Adam that he and his sons shall live thereon.
And Michael shall teach him to sow it, and to gather it in at harvest.'
Then Jesus called Michael, and said unto him, ' Take this [grain], and give it unto Adam so that he and all his sons may live thereon.'
And Michael came to Adam, and he was on the Jordan,
And Michael said unto him, 'Peace be to thee!
The Lord hath heard thy prayer, and He hath sent unto thee a seed of grain.'
And when Adam heard these words from Michael, his body recovered its strength, and he came from the water, and cast himself down at the feet of Michael.
'And Michael gave unto him the grain which had been sealed with the seal of light, and he taught him how to sow it and to reap it, and he went up into heaven with [great] glory.
'Therefore the water, and the wheat-plant, and grain, and the throne of the Father stand in one category, and they are the equals of the Son of God.
Now I John saw these things, and I rejoiced when I had heard them.
And it came to pass after these things that the Cherubim raised me up upon his wing of light, and carried me into the Seventh Heaven,
and I saw mighty miracles take place therein.
I saw [there] all the ranks of the angels.
The first rank [contained] the Seraphim, who were dressed in the grain-plant, and they had golden censers in their hands, and they said, ‘Hallelujah!’
And I saw another great and wonderful thing.
Whilst I John was looking at the angels as they were all divided into ranks, I found that the name of Michael was written upon all their garments, and that the angels were crying out his name always.
And I answered and said unto the Cherubim, 'How doth it come to pass that the name of Michael is written upon their garments? And wherefore do they cry it out?’
'And the Cherubim answered and said unto me, 'No angel is allowed to come upon the earth unless the name of Michael is written upon his garments, for otherwise the Devil would lead them astray.’
After this I saw a great fountain of water, whereof the waters were as white as snow, or as I might say, its waters were like unto milk, and there was an angel standing above it,
Then the heavens opened on this side and on that and everywhere,
and I saw a great and mighty angel come forth from the heavens, and they called his name Michael,
and he was girt about the loins with a girdle of gold.
There was a sponge in his hand, wherewith he wiped away all the tears of the angel of wrath,
and he drove the Angel of Wrath afar, saying, 'Get thee gone from this fountain, thou Angel of Wrath, for thou wishest to bring a famine upon the earth.'
And I said unto the Cherubim, 'My Lord, shew me the matter of the Angel of Wrath whose eyes drop blood into the fountain'
He said unto me, 'Seest thou the Angel of Wrath? He is the Angel of Famine.
If Michael were to cease from the wiping away of his tears (of blood) which he letteth drop, and were to allow them to enter the fountain, the (water thereof) would come to an end and the dew which falleth down upon the earth, and diseases and dissensions would break out, and the land would be smitten with famine'
And moreover, he said unto me, ' There are forty legions of angels, each legion containing ten thousand angels, who sing hymns over the dew until it cometh upon the earth, without any blemish at all in it.
And Apa Victor resisted the Duke strenuously.
And the Duke said unto him
Wilt thou offer up sacrifice or not?
but Apa Victor answered him not a word.
And when the Duke saw that he would not speak, he commanded his men to bring six lighted torches, and to fasten them to his sides (or, ribs). And when they had done this he made them bring a number of red-hot pointed irons,
and they thrust them through his belly until they came out of his back.
And they did these things three times to him until his skin peeled off him.
Afterwards the Duke said unto him
Wilt thou not (now) offer up sacrifice?
And the Duke commanded his men to place hot ashes upon his head, and to put a helmet (of iron) on him
and Apa Victor did not sink under this torture.
And the Duke made them to take him off the frame of the rack,
and to lay him upon the bed of iron and to kindle a fire beneath it.
And he made them pour burning sulphur and pitch, (mixed with other) inflammable substances, down his throat
And the Duke said unto him, 'Hearken unto me, and do not die a death of torture.
Is it not better for thee to be with me? Do thou not wish to live with me? Dost thou not know that thy Lords, the Emperors, arc they who have written (to me) concerning thee?'
And Apa Victor was not able to answer a word because of the pain which he was suffering from his torturing for the bed of iron was exceedingly hot under him.
And the Duke said unto Apa Victor
Speak one word into me, and I will release thee, O thou unholy exile!
And Apa Victor said unto the Duke
Seeing that I did not hearken unto my father nor unto the Emperor when they made entreaty to me, and seeing that I continued my disobedience to the point that I forsook all my possessions
And Apa Victor stood up and prayed in the midst of the fire, saying
I beseech thee, O my Lord Jesus the Christ, to be unto me a helper, and to assist me in all my tribulations, for I am a wretched and most miserable creature, in order that all this city may know that there is no other God besides Thee, Who art (God) alone.'
And at that very moment the holy Arehangel Michael came down from heaven
and went into the furnace of the bath
and spread out his holy apparel over Apa Victor,
and he caused the flame of fire to become like the dew at the first hour of the day. And he lifted him up on his wing of light, and the wing turned  into a green meadow.
And Michael broke the iron fetters which were fastened upon his hands and his feet
Apa Victor remained talking to together concerning the mysteries of the kingdom which is in the heavens, and the city of the righteous.
And after [these things] the Duke said unto those who were sitting with him, and unto the men of Rakote
O ye Alexandrians, Jesus shall not deliver him out of my hands, for there arc no gods besides Apollo and Artemis
And the Duke stripped off his clothes in order that he might go into the bath to bathe, and Michael raised up the (stone) slab of the bath, and thrust Apa Victor upon it.
And Ana Victor said unto the Duke,
O thou lawless man, why dost thou revile my God? Thou art wondering where thy god Apollo is, and thou sayest, 'Offer up sacrifice unto the gods who cannot move'
Nevertheless thou knowest well that there is power in my God to deliver me from thy tortures.
And Armenius the Count said unto him,
This day do I know that thou art an arch-magician, and that thou dost work magic'
And the Duke set out to leave the bath, and he mounted his horse, and sentenced Apa Victor to be beheaded.'
And the magistrates (or, authorities) and the people of Rakote made entreaty to the Duke that he would not put Apa Victor to death in their city
because they were afraid lest Apa Victor's father would destroy the whole city on account of it, saying
'He is a mighty general. Let him be banished to the south of Egypt, and let them put Apa Victor to death there.'
Then the Duke meditated within himself, saying,
What shall I gain by making his father an enemy of mine?
Then the Duke took a sheet of skin, and he wrote thereon the following words:
I, Armenius, the Duke of Rakote, write to Eutuchianus, the Count of the Thebaid.
And on the twentieth day of Pharmoute they banished the blessed man Apa Victor,
and four soldiers brought him to the south in ten days.
There was a collar of iron about his neck, and there were chains on his hands, and ankle-fetters on his legs, and the torturings had made him weak and helpless.
And when the soldiers arrived at Antinoe they tied up the boat to the shore
and they found that the governor had that day departed for the south.
And they unfurled their sail, and set out for the south
and they overtook the Count (of the Thebaid) as he was lying becalmed in mid-stream, for there was no wind.
And the soldiers brought Apa Victor into the lower part of the boat — now he had neither eaten nor drunk for twelve days —
and they delivered him over to Eutuchianus, the Duke
and they gave him a supply of food according to what the Count of Rakote had commanded.
And Apa Victor said in his heart,
There is something which this lawless man shall do for me, besides that which is in my body.'
Then the Count Eutuchianus commanded them to tie up the boat to the shore, and to set up his seat of justice at that place.
And when the morning of the following day had come they prepared for him a seat of justice there.
And Apa Victor passed the whole night in the lower part of the boat, blessing God and saying,
Blessed art Thou O King of all the ages (or, worlds) the Father the Almighty, and Thine only- begotten Sou Jesus the Christ, our Lord, Who hast delivered me in every place whither they have taken me.
And Eutuchianus said unto him,
For what reason didst thou not offer up sacrifice before thou didst submit to these tortures?
However, come now, and offer up sacrifice with the men who are here, so that it may be well with thee.'
And Apa Victor answered and said,
I am not at all afraid of men, and I will not offer up sacrifice, but I am afraid of my Lord Jesus the Christ.
For it is written, 'Be not afraid of those who can kill your bodies upon the earth, because there is nothing besides this which they can do unto you. But fear ye Him Who hath the power to destroy your souls and your bodies in Gehenna.'
And the Duke said unto him,
Hast thou come hither to persuade (or, convert) us by a homily which is vain?
If thou darest again to utter words in my presence I will make my servants to tear out thy tongue.
Unless thy father compel me to release thee I will not set thee free, and though profane and sacrilegious persons ought not to be cast into the furnace of a bath, thou art worthy of death,
and death shall now be thy portion.'
And the Duke commanded his servants to fasten the hands of Apa Victor behind him,
and they cut out his tongue and cut off the outer parts of his lips. And he made them bring out his necessary organs, and poured boiling oil upon them
And the Duke said unto him,
Wilt thou offer sacrifice or not,
or wilt thou die by torture?'
And the blessed man Apa Victor said unto the Duke,
Woe be unto thee, O Duke!
Thou deniest God for the sake of things which have been made by the hands of man, and thou and thine Emperors shall be punished with severe punishment.'
And Eutuchianus was wroth, and he took an oath by the life of the Emperor and by the lives of the gods,
and he said unto Apa Victor, 'Since thou wilt not sacrifice, and since thou hast been put to shame on the rack,
I must destroy thee by banishment until thou shalt die.'
nd Epiphanius the recorder answered and said,
Hearken unto me, and let me say this thing unto thee, O my Lord Count.
Behold, there is a certain Camp very far away in the south which is deserted, and there is no man living in it.
Behold, it is fifteen years since I became a soldier, and (during that time) I have never seen any one in it.
Now, therefore, banish Apa Victor to that place, (and keep him there) until he shall die.'
And the Count of the Thebaid commanded (that this should be done, and he passed) sentence on him, saying,
I, Eutuchianus, hereby command that this profane man Victor be taken to the Camp of Hierakion and that he be compelled to remain there until he die.'
And the noble man Apa Victor was strong and of good courage, and he related to the four (soldiers) his sufferings in the place of torture up to that time.
And it came to pass on a certain day that Apa Victor was outside the place of torture and the Devil came unto him in the form of a soldier, and said unto him,
Hail, Apa Victor.
I am a soldier of the imperial Palace, and thy father hath sent me unto thee to give thee this message:
Rise up, come back to me here, so that I may make thee a general.
Have I not suffered pain [in longing] for thee? Come back, so that I may make thee [a general].
Wilt thou not hearken unto me?
It is thou thyself alone who hast drawn upon thy head these sufferings.
Other people, strangers, are eating up thy goods.'
Dost thou not know that thou art an only son,
and that thy parents have no son (but thee) to succeed them?
They have adopted (?) as a son the offspring (?) of (one) of their slaves.
And now he rideth the horses, and (the Emperor) hath made him a Count in thy place.
He weareth thine apparel, and meanwhile thou art destroying thy soul with tribulations. And behold, thou art dwelling in this desert place!
Art thou not afraid lest thieves attack thee by night?
Then the Devil began to produce a written letter,
and he unrolled it before Apa Victor, and said unto him,
Look at this, and thou wilt recognize the handwriting of thy father and his seal.'
And when the hater of what is good, that is to say, the Devil, saw him, he became angry with a very great anger, for he could not contain himself when he saw the great ascetic labours which John performed in his daily life, and the great renown (which he obtained).
Therefore the Devil brought into his mind the remembrance of his parents,
and he endeavoured continually to make him remiss in his exercises. And moreover he made him to become more and more apathetic in the observance of his frequent fastings, and his vigils which lasted the whole night long.
And the body of John became weak and infirm, and he became more and more emaciated.
And when the Archimandrite saw him he marvelled at the weakness which had come upon him, for he was wellnigh ready to die,
and he said unto him, ' Have I not told thee from the very beginning that God doth not demand from us anything which is beyond our strength,
and yet thou hast made thyself weak and helpless through the exhaustion caused by thine excessive labours?
And on the morrow John rose up and came to the Archimandrite,
and cast himself down at his feet, and wept, saying, ' O my lord father wish to see my parents,
but I entreat thee to I pray for my wretched state, and perhaps thou wilt continue to do so, that God may make me perfect in patient. endurance until I trample upon all the powder of the Enemy; besides the command (hath come) to me to go.'
Then the Archimandrite assembled all the brethren that they might pray mighty prayers over him, and weep over him many tears,
and after that he sent him away, saying, 'My son, go thou in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost
for it is He Who shall go with thee, and it is He Who shall guide thee.'
And John rose up and took the Gospel of gold which his parents had prepared for him,
and he entreated the remainder of the old men to pray for him.
And at that moment John rose up, and saluted all the brethren, saying, 'Pray for me, O my fathers and my brethren
And having received the salutation of the brethren he came forth from the monastery and departed.
And when he had travelled a short distance from the monastery he turned his face round
and looked at the monastery,
 and he wept bitterly and shed many tears.
And after the weeping he went on his way until he drew nigh to the entrance of the city.
And whilst he was travelling along he met a very infirm man who was dressed in ragged garments, and in pieces of shrivelled leather(?).
And John said unto him, ' Hail, my brother!
Come and walk with me.'
And the brother said unto him, 'Hail, my lord brother!
As soon as ever I had seen thee I rejoiced. Let us walk together.'
And John said unto him, 'I see that thou art exceedingly weary, and that the apparel which is on thee is in rags.
I beseech thee to give them to me, and I will give unto thee the apparel which I am wearing.'
And straightway John stripped his apparel off him and stood naked, and gave it unto the infirm man.
And the infirm man blessed John,
and they marched on together until they arrived at the city into which the infirm man was going;
and they straightway saluted each other, and each man went his own way.
And when John had arrived at the city wherein his parents were
he cast himself down upon his face and wept,
and he worshipped the Lord, saying, ' O my Lord Jesus the Christ, forsake Thou me not.'
And straightway he came into the gateway of his parents, and he cast himself down by the threshold of the door,
And straightway John sat down by the door of the gateway of the house of his parents,
 and he slept there until the morning.
And on the following' morning- the porter opened the door of the gateway, according to custom,
and when he saw John sitting by the door, dressed in very ragged apparel,
he said unto him, ' O man, what hath come to thee that thou darest to come into this place,
and to sit down herein dressed in such filthy garments?
Get up out of the place wherein thou art sitting, and let me clean it before my master cometh down,
for if thou do not, and he see thee, he will quarrel with me.'
And John said anto him, 'I entreat thee, O my brother, do not cast me outside, for I am an infirm and miserable man.'
And the porter had compassion upon him,
and allowed him to sit inside his parents' gateway.
And at the time of dawn his parents came out,
and John saw them,
and he wept tears in such great quantities that his whole body was soaked thereby,
and John communed with himself, saying, 'Behold my parents!
Thou hast seen them.
 My Lord Jesus the Christ, forsake Thou me not.'
nd he sat in the gateway of his parents for a full year.
And his father sent unto him his food every day from his own table, not knowing that he was his son.
And John said unto him, 'My brother, I beseech thee do not thou withdraw from me thy gracious kindness which thou hast shewn me hitherto,
but do thou make for me a little hut, and a little space wherein I can go, so that thy lady may not quarrel with thee.'
And the things which were sent unto John every day he gave away in charity to the poor and to those who were in want, and he ate no part of them himself except bread and salt.
And the brethren in the city who were helpless came to him, and he fed them.
And the body of John through his excessive labours became so greatly emaciated that his bones became ever more and more apparent (through his skin).
And after ten years of days, when the Good God had seen the greatness of his self abnegation, and his ascetic labours, and his fortitude, the Lord appeared unto him by night in a vision, and said unto him, 'Hail, John!
Inasmuch as, according to the name which hath been given unto thee, that is to say, John, thou hast lived the life of a virgin as did he (i. e. John the Apostle), and hast forsaken this world, and all the glory thereof,
behold, the period of the sufferings which thou hast suffered hath come to an end, and all the contendings which thou hast undertaken in My Name.
Three days longer remain unto thee in this world before thou art to come up to Me in the heavens, wherein thou shalt rest with My saints,'
And John rose up from the vision,
and he wept, saying, ' I bless Thee, my Lord Jesus the Christ.
I am wholly unworthy to live, (and I am not) worthy to look upon the faces of the saints.
But I beseech Thee, my Lord, on behalf of my parents, that Thou mayest incline to be gracious unto them, and to forgive them their sins, for Thou, O Almighty God, art alone sinless.'
And when the blessed John had said these things he called to the gate-keeper
There is, however, yet one other thing which I would ask of thee, namely, that thou wouldst go and inform thy mistress of a small matter which I will declare unto thee.'
But she did not wish to go to John.
And again John sent a message unto her a second time, saying, 'I would have thee to know that there remain unto me in this world (only) three more days.
If thou wilt come I will talk with thee, and will tell thee the matter before I die
and if thou wilt not come thou wilt grieve when I am dead.
And when she heard about his death she rose up and came down,
and she said unto her servant, 'Go on, take me to this place.'
Then the servant called John unto her, but his mother did not recognize him by reason of the excessive ascetic labours which he had been in the habit of performing.
Then she remembered, and she wept bitterly, and her heart was disturbed exceedingly,
and she went straig'htway to her husband,
and she shewed him the Gospel, saying, ' Is this thine?
Find out to whom it belongeth.'
And he recognized the Gospel immediately, and he said, ' Verily, this is the Gospel of our beloved son John, and besides this there is no other.
And John said unto them ' Do ye not know who I am?
And they said unto him, 'How is it possible for us to know thee?
And he said unto them ' I am John, thy son, and this Gospel of gold is that for which I entreated you,
and I took it to the place whither I went
O how great was the mourning which took place in all the city on that day!
O how great were the outbursts of grief which took place among the nobles of the city! And rich and poor, and men and women, and little and great,
And his mother, through the greatness of her sorrow, and through the disturbance caused by the multitude, forgot the oath which she had sworn to her son,
And straightway an angel came
Here endeth the strife of Saint John, wherein he was mig-hty and prevailed.
by the zeal and care of our God-loving brother Zacharias, the deacon and monk of Saint Mercurius, in the Mountain of Atbo (Apollinopolis, Edfu, or TJtfu). He had this book made with (the fruit of) his own labour, he gave it to the sanctuary of Saint Mercurius in the Mountain of Atbo,
wherein he lived, for the salvation of his own soul, in order that Saint Mercurius, and all the other saints whose memorials are written in this book, one by one, according to his name, may bless him with every spiritual and celestial blessing and may graciously grant unto him the power to endure patiently, and may deliver him from all the wiles of the Devil and of evil-doing men, and may enable him to fulfil the serviee in the Holy Place, with him that hath inherited it, that is to say, as deacon and monk.
a number of wolves attacked me;
now they ejected a lot of dung on my back, and threw up very much dust about me,
 and I was obliged to abandon the beast whereon I was riding.
And again I cried out uttering prayers to God and to my holy father, Apa Pisentius, who had delivered me from the mouths of the hyenas, saying, ' Deliver thou me at this time also from these wolves.'
And before the words had escaped from my mouth one of the wolves let out a mighty cry,
and they all turned away and fled in another direction, through the prayers of my holy father, Apa Pisentius.
(Now) they all turned away through the prayers of my father Apa Pisentius.
Now as for me, I entered into the plain of the mountain of Tsente, and I ascribed glory to God because of what had happened to me, namely that He had delivered me from the mouths of (these) evil beasts.
And when I had entered into the heart [of the mountain], I found her (i. e. the beast he had abandoned) ; and the holy man was engaged in studying [the book of a] certain prophet.
Then I took the beast into the shed for the animals,
and my father was looking down on me [as I did so] from the wall of the tower.
And he said unto me, O John; and I made answer to him, saying, 'Bless me, my father!'
And he said unto me, 'Have I not told thee that thou art not to travel by the inner road late in the day, and that thou art only to do so in the early morning?
A very little more and the wild beasts would have eaten thee up ; they would have done so now had it not been for the mercy of God.
Thus ye may see, O my beloved, that he always knew what was happening, and no matter where the place was wherein any event happened, he was always certain to know about that event.
But he kept it secret, according to the habit of his life, for he did not desire to give any man cause to give to him the approbation which appertaineth to men, even as the wise man Paul spake, saying, 'I seek not the pnc glory of men, nor of yourselves, nor of others.'
Now, if I wished to tell you concerning all the works which we have seen done by the blessed old man Apa Pisentius, this discourse would become inordinately long,
but inasmuch as the Scriptures inform us, saying, ' The works of God are good, make thou them manifest unto every one, I will relate unto you a few more deeds, out of a very large number, concerning the splendid acts of this perfect man, and afterwards we will bring our discourse to a close.
Now it came to pass on a day that a certain man came unto him from the district of Kebt (Coptos), and there was travelling with him his son, who had reached a time of life when he might, very properly, have been permitted to undergo the yoke of matrimony.
And the two men went together into the presence of [the holy man Apa Pisentius], and they bowed low [before him], and cast themselves down at his feet.
And the holy man said unto the man, ' Why hast thou not taken a wife for thy son?
now that man was an inhabitant of the town of Coptos.
And the man answered and said, 'My father, he is a mere boy, and hath not yet arrived at the proper age for marriage; and he is prudent.
And the holy man answered and said, 'Verily thy son is a habitual fornicator, and if thou permittest him, he will tell [thee] the truth.
The man said, 'If he be a fornicator, behold, I will put him into thy hands, so that thou mayest do unto him whatsoever it pleaseth thee.'
And the holy prophet answered and said, 'When thou goest to enter into thy village thou shalt meet a certain woman in the first street of thy village
she is the daughter of such and such a man, and that which is inside her shall bear witness to thee that it is thy son who hath been sleeping with her.
But do not think that I say this wholly and solely of myself, most assuredly not, for I have been informed concerning this matter by certain men who are worthy to be believed.
Nevertheless, if thou wilt hearken unto me thou wilt take her for him to wife, inasmuch as he hath humiliated her;
and, in truth, I shall be unable to permit him to partake of the Mysteries until he hath taken her to wife.
For the Law commandeth : 'If a man lie with a maiden unto whom he hath not been betrothed, and he take her by force, and he be [found] with her, he shall give fifty 'crowns' to her [father], now fifty shekels is the proper price of a virgin,
and he shall live with her, because he hath humbled her, whether she be a poor maiden or whether she be a rich maiden'
Now therefore, since the Devil made thy son to fall in with the woman, do thou depart, and take her for him to wife.
Do not give him the opportunity to commit sin, because God will enquire of thee concerning the salvation of his soul.
For if thou wilt make him to enter into the estate of holy matrimony, and he fall afterwards into this sin, his blood by these means shall be on his own head, and on his only.
Do not give him the chance of making thee alone the excuse for his sin before the throne of the Christ, and of saying, 'My father would not take a wife for me' for then the whole danger of his sin would be upon thee, because thou hast taught him the Law of God carelessly, even as it is pointed out in the Holy Scriptures concerning Eli, the priest, saying, 'He taught his sons the Law of God carelessly.'
Then the man answered and said, ' Every word which thou hast spoken I will truly keep,
for he who sheweth himself disobedient to thee sheweth himself disobedient towards the Christ, because the words which come forth from thy mouth are the words of life.
Then the blessed Apa Pisentius said unto him, ' The Lord be with you; depart in peace,'
and they came away from his presence, and they did as he had commanded them, and their hearts enjoyed great rest.
And again it came to pass on a day that our holy father Apa Pisentius, the bishop, passed through the village to inspect his churches.
Now when he had finished he looked on them (i. e. the people), and when he was returning to the monastery, and was passing along the way by the canal, a certain husbandman brought to him an ewe which belonged to him in order that he might make the Sign of the Cross over her.
Observe ye now the power of God.
The Sign of the Cross which the holy man made on her with his finger sank down into her womb,
and when she brought forth her lamb they found on it the Sign of the Cross with which the holy man had marked her.
Now the holy man made the Sign of the Cross on the outside of the ewe, and it appeared on the body of the lamb in the form of a piece of white wool, which was like unto snow.
And in every man who was sick, no matter of what kind his sickness might be, immediately the holy man Apa Pisentius stretched out his hand over him, and made the Sign of the Cross over him, the sickness ceased.
Come ye then, all ye whose hearts are straight in respect of God and the holy man,
and let us make supplication unto him with tears and with repentance, in order that Apa Pisentius may entreat the Christ to shew mercy upon us when it shall come to us to meet Him face to face; for it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God.
Now if there be among you any one who shall be so bold as to waste his time in trying to refute the statement which I have dared to make to the effect that the holy man, Apa Pisentius, the bishop, is a companion of the Christ, let him come now and consider the words which are in the holy Gospel according to John, and let him hear God crying out by the mouth of His holy and beloved one John the Evangelist, saying, ' Ye are My companions when ye do the things which I have commanded you.
And again, 'To you whom I have called 'My friends', all the things which I have heard from My Father I have shewn unto you.'
And again 'It is not ye who have chosen Me, but it is I who have chosen you,
and I have left you in order that your fruit may be abiding, and may live for ever.'
Know ye therefore, O my beloved, that he who doeth the will of God, the same is His companion and His friend, even according to what is said in the holy Gospel, ' He who shall do the will of My Father which is in the heavens, this same is My brother, and My sister, and My mother.'
And again it came to pass on a day that they brought unto him a certain youth who was possessed of a demon,
and they besought the holy man, saying, 'Do an act of gracious goodness, and be pleased to make the Sign of the Cross over him, for the demon which possesseth him is exceedingly evil.'
And the holy man asked his father, saying, 'Did this calamity come upon him a very long time ago?'
And the father of the youth said unto him, 'Behold, it is seven years, [since we have asked] thy prayers, O my father.
And the demon is in the habit of casting him on the ground, and of making him to stagger about like a camel, his eyes being filled with blood,
and often and often this has continued until we were in despair about him, thinking that the demon would kill him.
And (sometimes) he doth not speak at all. Do an act of gracious goodness, and be pleased to help him, O my father.^
Then my father cried out unto me, ' John.'
And he said unto me, Go thou to the laver of the congregation, and bring hither to me a little water, so that I may sprinkle it upon this youth, for I cannot endure seeing this demon inflicting such severe suffering upon him.'
I went therefore into the room of the assembly, according to the command of my lord and father, the blessed Apa Pisentius, and I made Apa Elisha, the presbyter and overseer of the place (or, shrine), go into the place of the altar of sacrifice
and he poured a little of the water which was there into a vessel, and I brought it to the holy man
and the holy man dipped his finger in this water, and made the Sign of the Cross on the youth in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
And he gave some of the water to his father, saying unto him, 'Take thou thy son, and depart thou to thy house, and thou shalt give him to drink of this water which I have given thee from the laver of the congregation, and thou shalt believe in the Lord, and He shall heal him.'
Now, my father acted in this way and did not himself give the youth the water to drink with his own hands, and so make the demon come out from him immediately, lest men should ascribe praise to him, and say, Apa Pisentius hath cast the demon out of the son of such and such a man, because he did not wish to receive glorifying from the children of men.
And it came to pass that when the man had taken his son, that he might depart to his house, now, according to what the man himself confessed to me with his own mouth, (this happened) a few days after, whilst he was taking him back home, (and the man said), 'Whilst I was walking along with my son,
and when I was a long way from you, the demon suddenly hurled him to the ground, and made him writhe in agony, and then cried out inside him, Pisentius, by the Sign of the Cross which thou didst make with thy finger, thou hast driven me forth from my dwelling-place'
And immediately that the youth was purified I took him into my house with joy, and the demon never returned to him to the day of his death.'
And it came to pass that after a few days, the (father of the youth) went to the great man,
and he made obeisance to him, and he laid hold of his hand, saying, 'I tell thee that the young man is free from the demon.'
And the father of the youth confessed to him, saying, 'I tell thee, O my father, that immediately I had given him to drink of that water which thy fatherhood gave to me,
the merciful Lord graciously bestowed healing upon my son through thy holy prayers.'
And Apa Pisentius answered, saying, 'Everything is possible to him that believeth; and assuredly the water which is in the chamber of the altar of sacrifice healeth every one who believeth.
And do not think that this gracious healing is to be attributed to me, for assuredly it is in no way whatsoever due to me, but to the power of God which abideth in His holy shrine, and is given unto those who enter therein in sincere faith and with a heart wherein is no unbelief.
As for me, O my son, I am the least of anything in a matter of this kind.'
And when Apa Pisentius had said these words, the man departed from his presence, and ascribed glory to God, and rendered abundant thanks to my blessed father.
And again it came to pass on a day that the spirit of jealousy invaded the heart of a certain man,
and he became jealous about his wife.
And the Devil, the hater of that which is good, and who longeth to do evil to the race of mankind, cast a stumbling-block into the heart of her husband in respect of a man whom he believed to have had carnal intercourse with his wife.
Now the woman was innocent of that offence, and the man who was accused was himself innocent of the charge of impurity which was brought against him in respect of the woman, even as the story itself will teach us if we proceed with it to the end.
So the husband cast out his wife from his house because of the evil which existed in his own heart in respect of her.
And his father and his mother both took the greatest pains, but were wholly unable to convince the mind of the husband [of his wife's innocence], and to make him to live with her;
even according to that which Solomon spake, 'The heart of her husband is full of jealousy Finally the matter came to the ears of the clergy of his village, who had made him an assistant in the administration of the Holy Mysteries,
and the clergy informed my holy father concerning the matter.
Then my father sent a message to him, saying, 'Trouble (not) thyself : I will find for thee the defence which is necessary.
And the husband spread abroad rumours throughout the village, and he went about from place to place threatening, and saying, 'I will never again go to Pisentius;
what hath Pisentius to do with my affair?'
Now the man was a native of the town of Kebt (Coptos).
And during the time in which he was uttering (these) words he became more and more angry.
And when the sun was about to depart to his place of sunset on that same day
now it was God Who said in [the Book of] the Prophet, ' Cast [thy] dispute upon Me, I will avenge thee,' saith the Lord
a certain terrible sickness came upon that man with the darkness,
and he began to suffer great tortures in his inward parts, which caused him intense pain, and he cried out with a loud voice, saying, ' Take me to my father Apa Pisentius, for I tell thee that (these) pains have come upon me through him.
O my father, do a loving act, and help me, for indeed I am come into the straits of death (i.e. to the last gasp). And if thou dost not take me to him, I shall never find relief
And his father and his mother despaired (of his life), and thought that he would die.
And they said, 'Since he saith ''Take me to Apa Pisentius, the bishop', if he is to live, let us persuade ourselves to do as he saith.
In any case, if we take him to him, and he make the Sign of the Cross over him, at least the tortures which he is suffering will be lessened.
Now this took place very soon after my father Apa Pisentius had been made a bishop.
Then they took the sick man up to the mountain to my father, and they called out inside (the court), and I (John) went out to them.
And the father of the man said unto me, ' John, if thou wouldst ever look upon me again, do an act of love, and inform the great man,
for if thou dost not my son is in danger of dying, and I believe by God, that if he were to make the Sign of the Cross over my son he would find relief immediately.
He hath entreated me, saying, 'Take me to Apa Pisentius, the bishop, in order that I may have relief from these pains by which, through his agency, I am suffering torture.'
Now if I were to discuss the matter with the bishop in my present distracted state, I should talk like a man without understanding.'
And his son also cried out to me, saying, ' O John, do an act of love, take in the news of my arrival to the great man, for the straits of death have come upon me.
Behold thou seest me thyself in my necessity.
O why did I not keep my mouth shut, and why did I not die before I repeated the report that day?
Get thee in quickly, and inform my lord and father Apa Pisentius about my sufferings.
Help thou me, and do not abandon me to death on thy threshold
And when I had heard these things from the man and from his son, I went in and informed my father concerning (the arrival of) the man and his son.
And he said unto me, 'Keep away from him until he maketh the petition in a proper manner, for he is not a man without education.'
And I answered and said unto him, 'If I leave him outside a very little longer, he will die.
The breath which is left in him at this moment is very little, and according to what I see of him he hath contracted a fatal disease
Then my father said unto me, ' Let him (enter) in with thee.'
And when he had come in with his father, he threw himself down at the feet of my father, and remained there for a long time.
And my father said unto him, ' Rise up, O thou boorish man/
And the man answered and said, 'As the Lord liveth, if I have to pass three whole days kneeling at thy feet I will do so; unless thou liftest up thy feet on my head, I will not rise up.'
And my father laid hold upon the hair of his head,
and lifted him up, and he said unto him, 'Rise up, for behold God will bestow healing upon thee graciously, if only thou wilt hearken unto me.'
And the man answered and said, ' I swear by my necessity wherefrom thy prayers have delivered me, that whether I live one year (more) or two, I will never, never again dare to be disobedient unto thee.'
And my father answered and said unto him, ' What I have to lay upon thee is this—Thou hast driven thy wife out of thy house for no reason whatsoever.
And as concerneth the offence wherewith thou hast charged her in thy mind, she and the man also are both innocent.
But I say unto thee, supposing that thou wishest to be wholly satisfied in respect of her, and in respect of the man about whom thou hast thought evil in thy mind
now, my son, man looketh at the face only, but God looketh at the heart
when thou goest into thy house, take thy wife back into the house,
and God shall make thee to be acceptable unto her,
and if she shall incline unto thee, and shall conceive and bring forth a man child unto thee, (thou wilt know that) the report which hath been spread abroad about her is not true.
And believe me, for she is a free woman.
If, however, she shall bear thee a daughter, live not with her, but cast her forth from thy house,
for she is not innocent of the offence wherewith they have charged her, and she hath defiled her marriage (bed).
But if it be a man child which she shall bring forth, the report which hath been spread abroad about her is not true,
and she is innocent of the charge of which she was thought to be guilty.
And if thou wishest to make her swear an oath I shall not attempt to prevent thee, for the law of God giveth the following command:
If the wife of any man step out of the path, and he shall have no knowledge whatsoever of it, and another man shall lie with her and shall know her carnally, and the matter be hidden from her husband, and he knoweth nothing at all about it, and the woman herself doth not conceive, and there be no witness to stand up and testify against her, the woman shall be taken to the priest, and he shall make her take the oath, and he shall give her the water of the curse, and she shall drink it.
If the offence wherewith she is charged hath been actually committed, that water shall make her body to become covered with burning pustules (and) leprosy.
But if it be that she hath been accused falsely, she shall conceive a son.'
And now, O my son, if thou art quite satisfied about the matter, (good and well); but if not, make her take the oath. I shall not attempt to prevent thee.'
And the man answered and said, 'From that very moment when thy fatherhood (began) to speak to me my heart hath been satisfied about the matter. And I shall never po^ again hesitate to obey thee.'
And he received a blessing from the holy man, and he came forth from his presence
and departed to his house with his father, glorifying God and the holy man Apa Pisentius.
Now when he had gone into his house, he made peace with his wife, and begot a son according to the word of Apa Pisentius, who was like unto an Apostle.
And the man called the name of his son ' Pisentius ',
and he lived with his wife from that very day until the day of his death.
And the holy man performed three miracles, each of which was more wonderful than the other, and these are they: (the miracle) of the woman whom he delivered from the false accusation wherewith she had been charged; and [the miracle] of the man who was made a free man ; and the a setting free of the body of the husband of a woman, on whose navel a spell had been cast by the power of Satan,
and the making of those who had been married to live together in peace again.
Verily, exceedingly great is thy wonderful life, O thou angel of the Lord of Might!
For who is able to recount all the wonderful things which have taken place through thee, both those which belong to the period of thy youth (or, childhood), and those which have taken place during the time in which thou didst lead the life of a monk?
And as for those which took place through thy hands after thou didst become bishop, and which thou didst order, and didst wish that no man should ever gain any knowledge of them whatsoever, no man could possibly describe them completely.
Now ye must not make the soul of the blessed man to condemn me because I have related these few matters in (my) Encomium upon him, for I think that we have not exceeded the measure in declaring merely these few unimportant matters.
But let us hearken to the following commandment with which the Apostle commanded us, saying, ' Give ye unto every one such things as ye have, tribute to whom tribute is due, tax to whom tax is due, fear to whom fear is due, honour to whom honour is due/
Verily, (O Apa Pisentius,) thou art worthy of all honour and all glory, according to that which the Psalmist David saith, 'Bring honour and reverence unto the Lord, bring glory unto His holy Name'
Now hearken ye unto another great and wonderful thing, and ascribe ye glory unto the Lord!
And it came to pass on another occasion that a certain man came unto him, and made supplication unto him, saying, 'I beseech thee to perform an act of love, and to help me, O my lord and father. There is an obligation on me in respect of a certain man of thirty-six 'holokottinoi' they are pressing me urgently concerning them,
and I am not able to find them to pay them P^^ to him.
And I possess nothing whatsoever except a son, my only son, and him they have seized,
and they have put him securely in the guard-house (i. e. prison), and they are wishing to make him a slave.
I beseech thy fatherhood to shew compassion upon me.
If there was any one whom thou couldst cause to give me this small sum I could go and give it to the man, and then they would let my only son go free.'
Now that man was a soldier, and he was a native of the district, and he dwelt in a part (?) of the mountain of Teiladj.
And having heard of the fame of my father, and that he was a most charitable and generous bishop, he rose up
and came to him with his wife, and he wished to find out whether he was one who gave alms freely or not.
Now he put the woman again into the boat in which he brought her,^ and he hid thirty-six 'holokottinoi' in the boat . . . with her ;
now these he had carried off from a man whose blood he had shed,
And he came to my father wishing to try him and to see whether that which he had heard about him was true or not.
Now the day whereon he came to the holy bishop Apa Pisentius was that in which the bishop had gone into the holy congregation of Tsentei, and had taken part in the Catholic Synaxis,
for it was the day of the festival of the Archbishop and Patriarch, Apa Severus, Archbishop of Antioch.
And he sat down until Apa Pisentius came out from the congregation, when he cast himself down at his feet, and informed him of the matter whereof I have already spoken.
And when the great man had heard it, he said unto the soldier through an interpreter, 'The place of Pisentius is not a place for jesting.
Get thee gone, and take the thirtysix {sic) six 'holokottinoi' from the hand of thy wife who is on board the boat by the place of the ferry.
As for the money (?), behold, it is tied up in a bundle in her hand, and it is this which thou hast brought to tempt me therewith.
Behold now what it was that thou didst wish to do. Because thou hadst shed the blood of a man,
and hadst taken (these moneys) out of his hand, thou didst say, 'I will take them and give them as an offering for the salvation of my soul.'
Verily I say unto thee, that if the whole world were given in alms on thy behalf then the smallest act of mercy shall never be shewn unto thee, until thine own blood hath been poured out even as thou hast poured out the blood of thy neighbour, according to that which is written. Whosoever sheddeth the blood of a I man, the blood of him that sheddeth it shall be shed in its stead, because man was made according to the image of God.'
Now when the man had heard these words he marvelled exceedingly, for he thought that the matter would l)e hidden from the new Elisha, and he did not know that the Spirit which spake to the Apostles was the same as that which spake in the Prophets,
and he did not know that the same God was the God of all of them.
Now ye know, (O my beloved,) that in the beginning of this Encomium I did not fail to say that the blessed man Apa Pisentius was endowed with the gift of the Spirit,
for one whenever any man went into his presence, as soon as he had looked into his face he knew for what purpose he had come to him.
But he hated the vain approbation of men, and he hid his manner of life so that no man whatsoever might attain to the full knowledge of the same.
Now it came to pass also on another occasion when he was fleeing from before the face of the Persians (that) he might lead a life of peaceful meditation in the mountain of Djeme,
that he departed into the mountain not a little way in order that he might pray.
And when he had passed three or four hours in travelling, he prayed in place after place,
and there is no man who is able to estimate the number of the prayers which he made by day and by night.
Now, he was in the habit of praying four hundred times during the night.
And he turned to me, and he said unto me, ' Take good heed to thyself,
for I found a huge serpent in the mountain to-day ; and he is not very far from us at this moment.
But I have confidence in God that He will not permit him to remain in our neighbourhood.'
Now when the morning had come, I looked out, and at the distance of about the flight of an arrow,
I saw a very large number of birds and vultures gathered together upon a crag of the rock.
And (my father) cried out to me, and said unto me, 'I think that God hath destroyed the dragon.'
And he spake yet again unto me and said, 'Why hast thou not given thine attention to the words of the Scriptures, and understood them, according to that which the wise man David saith: Thou hast set him that was higher than thou for a place of refuge ; The evil shall not draw nigh unto thee,
neither shall the evil draw nigh to thy habitation; Thou shalt go up upon the adder and the scorpion, thou shalt tread upon the lion and the serpent; Because he hath believed in Me I will deliver him, and I will protect him because he hath known My Name;
He shall cry out unto Me, and I will hearken unto him'
And it came to pass that God wished to remove him (from this world) to the habitation of those who rejoice, the place wherefrom sorrow, and grief, and sighing have fled away, the place where are the Prophets and the Patriarchs and the Apostles,
for he was a Patriarch like Abraham, and an Apostle like unto the Apostles, and a Prophet like unto the Prophets, even like unto Samuel, and those who came after him,
and he was a high priest (worthy of) reverence, even as were Moses and Aaron and those who came after them.
And when he had come to the end of the sickness through which he went to his rest, now it was in the month of Epep of the fifth year (?), he cried out to me on the night of the eighth day of Epep, and he said, ' John, is there any one with thee?'
And I said, 'There is no one with me save Moses, and Elisha the Elder, who have come to visit thee.'
And my father cried out, 'Moses, Moses, Moses.
Be careful to make thy life exceedingly correct.
Thou knowest in what manner thou hast been brought up by me.
Take thou great care of my parchment books, for thou wilt have great need for them. And thou shalt not escape from this burden.'
And again he turned to Elisha the Presbyter, and said unto him, Elisha, 'Govern thou most carefully the brethren. Lay fast hold upon the things which I have commanded thee, and do thou pne summon the brethren regularly each hour in order that they may recite their offices according to the rules of the brethren, and do good to their souls through thee.'
Then Elisha answered and said unto him, 'My father, I have approached (the time) for going to all my fathers.
If thou art going to die it is better that I should die first, for if the pillar whereon we are all firmly established shall fall, the destruction of the mountain of Tsentei will draw nigh.
And where shall we find another who will shepherd us as thou hast done, O my lord and holy father, if thou dost depart?
Thou hast directed and made straight the course of thy ship to the haven which is fair.
Thou hast prepared thyself, and thou shalt never be disturbed (or, troubled), according to the words of the gentle David, (who said,) I have prepared myself, I shall never be disturbed' (or, troubled).
For we shall feel the lack of thee sorely, and we shall be orphans from this day forward.
And my father answered and said unto me, 'Verily, five days were given unto me from the third day.'
And I answered and said unto him, 'What was it that happened unto thee that thou sayest these things to me?'
And he said unto me, 'Before I spake unto thee an ecstasy came upon me, and a man of light came and stood before me.
And he said unto me, 'Pisentius, Pisentius, Pisentius!'—three times
prepare thyself, for there remain unto thee in this world five days, and then thou shalt come to me.'
And when he had said these things unto me, he departed.
And now, behold, I must depart the way of all my fathers.'
And when my father had said these things unto me, a great outcry broke forth with tears and sobs in (our) midst; ' Thus are we bereaved of our good father, the consoler of those who were in trouble, who gave penitence to the sinner, who provided the poor with food, and who made it his care to find clothing for their bodies.'
And I confess unto you, (O my beloved), here in the presence of God, that from the time when my father heard concerning the Persians, he never applied to his own use any of the things which could be of use to the poor, even to the cap upon his head, but he distributed everything, and gave it in alms to the poor.
The things which he gave with his own hands, and the things which he commanded me to give, and the things which he sent to the faithful, village by village, and which were distributed to each man according to his need, no man can possibly know the sum thereof.
Only God, unto Whom all praise be given, knoweth it.
And I said unto my holy father, who arrayed himself in Christ, Apa Pisentius, 'Peradventure, O my father, dost thou think that we shall not again devote ourselves (to the poor), if thou dost not bequeath any possessions which may remain to us?'
My father answered and said unto me, ' We must devote ourselves to the will of God, O my son, and whatsoever thou givest—everything—to the poor,
the Lord will give unto us twofold.'
What can I say (more), or what can I relate of the valiant deeds of this just man ?
But now let us devote ourselves to the consideration of his laying down the body.
Now he passed three days wherein he neither ate nor drank, neither did he speak unto us, nor turn from one side to the other, but he lay stretched out like a dead man in the hall of the large cell.
Then he cried out, 'John,' and I answered, 'Bless me.'
He said unto me, 'I have come nigh unto my departure, and I shall finish my course at the time when the sun shall set to-morrow, which shall be the thirteenth day.
But take good heed and do not permit any man to carry my body away from the place which shall be dug for it.
During these three days which I have just passed wherein I held no converse with you, I have been standing in the presence of God, and my speech hath been taken away since the ninth hour yesterday.
I tell you that God will shew His mercy unto me.'
And I said unto him, 'Do one act of grace, O my father, and partake of a very small quantity of nourishment, for behold, it is now four days since thou hast tasted anything at all.'
And my father answered and said unto me, 'My son, shall I eat anything else after (this) word?
I say that I will not taste any food whatsoever belonging to this world,
I shall eat nothing at all until I depart to the Christ, and break my fast with Him.'
And it came to pass that when the light had risen on the thirteenth day of the month Epep, he said unto me—now there were also certain great men sitting by him—' John, thou knowest all my affairs, and that I have nothing left belonging to the bishopric (or) to the town of Kebt (Coptos) wherewith to bury my body.
Nevertheless, I had one good 'holokottinos' by me, which I had kept since the day when I lived a life of contemplation in my cell and when I was a monk.
This I made to yield an increase through the work of my hands, and I have guarded it carefully until the day wherein I should have to clothe my body with the work of my hands, so that I might not leave behind me a matter of unpleasantness for those who should succeed me,
 and who would say. Thou hast broken a custom which was seemly.
Do thou then, O John, buy a covering for my body, and do not put on me anything except the shroud wherein I am wrapped, and my monk's dress, and my skull-cap, and my girdle, and my tunic—only these—and ye shall prepare me for burial and ye shall bury me.
And I think. Behold a garden wherein they will bury me.
And behold, a place full of wolves, but they will throw a wall about [me], each one working at it according to his good pleasure.
But whatever each man doeth, let no man rebuke him, saying. The wall must be thrown round (the grave).'
And when the holy father Apa Pisentius, the holy bishop, had said these things, he cried out to us, and spake words unto (each) one of us,
and then he opened his mouth, and yielded up his spirit into the hands of God, at the moment when the sun was about to set on the thirteenth day of the month of Epep of this fifth year (of the Indiction).
And we lifted up his holy coffin, and we took it into the holy chamber of the altar of the congregation of Tsentei,
and we made it ready for burial according to the instructions which he had given us,
and we passed the whole night in lamentation for him.
And afterwards we partook of the Holy Offering over him,
and we carried him away into the mountain to the place which he had made us dig for him that he might remain in our neighbourhood.
And we buried him on the fourteenth day of this same month Epep. In the Peace of God. Amen. Amen.
And I cast myself upon the ground
and made obeisance unto them,
but they raised me up
and kissed me.
And they remained in a state of great dignity (?), and they were like unto beings who had transferred themselves from another world in respect for the joy and comfort which they displayed towards me;
and they gathered fruit from the trees and placed it in my mouth.
And as for me my heart rejoiced because of the affection which they shewed towards me,
and I passed seven days with them eating of the fruit of the trees.
And I asked them, saying, 'Whence have ye come to this place? And of what region are ye natives?'
And they said unto me, ``O our brother, God hath sent thee unto us so that we may declare unto thee our whole manner of life.
For we are natives of a city of Egypt called Pemdje (Oxyrhynchus).
Our fathers were councillors (or, magistrates) of the city, and they sent us to the school there to have us educated;
and we were all in the same school together, and we were all of the same mind.
when we had finished our education in the school they sent us on to the college,
and when we had been thoroughly well taught there and had learned therein all the learning (?) and all the wisdom of this world, we wished to be instructed in the wisdom of God.
And it came to pass on a certain day that whilst we were talking together about these things a good resolution stirred in our inner man,
and we four rose up,
 and we set ourselves on the way to the desert, so that we might live therein quietly until we should see what the Lord had ordained for us.
And we took with us a few loaves of bread, sufficient for seven days.
And when we had come into the mountain, straightway an ecstasy fell upon us,
and a man, who was all light, laid hold of our hands
and brought us into this place.
And when we had come into this place we found a holy man of God, and the angel of the Lord put us in his hand,
and he taught us to be servants of God for a year of days.
And at the end of the year the holy and blessed old man died,
and we remained by ourselves in this place.
``Behold, O our lord brother, we declare unto thee by God that for sixty years we have not known the taste of bread, or of any other kind of food except the fruit of these trees whereon we live.
If we wish to see each other we come here every week to do so. We pass the whole night of the First Day of the week together, and after that each one departeth to perform his spiritual labours [for the rest of the week].''
And I said unto them, 'Where do ye receive the Eucharist?''
And they said unto me, 'We assemble here for that purpose, for an angel of God cometh hither every Sabbath, and he administereth unto us the Eucharist on the Sabbath and on the First Day of the week.'
And I stayed with them, and I rejoiced exceedingly.
[And they said unto me], 'On the seventh day the angel of the Lord will come, and he will administer the Eucharist to thee and to us together.
And the man who shall receive the Eucharist at the hand of that angel shall be cleansed from all sin, and the Adversary shall never have dominion over him.'
And whilst we were talking together I smelled a strong sweet smell, the like whereof I never smelled before.
And immediately the sweet smell reached us we rose up, and we stood on our feet, and we blessed God.
And afterwards the angel came,
and he administered unto us the Eucharist, the Body and Blood of the Lord.
And I became like unto those who sleep, because of the awesome sight which I saw.
And he blessed us,
and he went up into heaven, and we watched him with our eyes.
And when he had gone up they comforted me,
and said unto me, ``Be of good cheer, for thou shalt prevail, and thou shalt become a man of might;''
and straightway I became of good cheer, even as those who are under [the influence of] wine.
And we stood on our feet during the [eve of] the First Day of the week, and we prayed the whole night long until the morning.
And when the light appeared at dawn on the First Day of the week, behold, we smelled that exceedingly sweet smell again,
and we enjoyed it, and we rejoiced after the manner of those who are in another world.
And afterwards the angel came,
and he administered unto us the Eucharist, and he blessed each one of us, saying, ``Everlasting life shall be unto thee, and [the power of] prophecy which shall never be destroyed.''
And we all, with one mouth and with one accord, answered and said, ``Amen; so be it!''
And afterwards the angel turned to me,
and said unto me, ``Arise, and depart thou to Egypt, and tell the God-loving brethren the things which thou hast seen, so that they may emulate the life and conversation of the saints.''
And I entreated him to let me remain with them,
but he said unto me, 'The Lord doth not allot unto us the work which is imagined by the heart, but God giveth unto each man according to what he is able to bear.
Now, therefore, arise and depart, for that is what the Lord hath ordained for thee.'
And he blessed me,
and went up into the heavens in great glory.
And they brought a large number of plums,
and we ate them together,
and I came forth from them, and they accompanied me on my way for a distance of six miles.
And I entreated them, saying, ``Declare unto me your names,''
and they declared me their names, each one of them.
The name of the first was John,
of the second Andrew,
of the third Heraklamon,
and of the fourth Theophilus;
and they commanded me to declare their names unto the brethren, [so that] they might remember them [in their prayers].
And I on my part entreated them to keep my name in remembrance.
And we prayed and we kissed each other.
And I journeyed forth, and I grieved exceedingly;
nevertheless, because of the blessing which the holy men had bestowed upon me, I rejoiced.
And I came into Egypt after a journey of three days,
and having found certain God-loving brethren I rested with them for ten days,
and I described unto them what had happened unto me;
and they said unto me, ``Verily thou art worthy of a great reward.''
Now those brethren were lovers of God, and they contended strenuously in the ascetic life, and they were worshippers of God with their whole hearts; and their place of abode was Shiet (Scete).
And they made haste and they wrote down these things which they had heard from Apa Papnoute,
and they quickly put them in a book,
which they sent to Shiet,
where it was deposited in the church for the benefit of those who should hear it [read].
And they spoke about it, and it was the subject of meditation in the mouth of everyone.
And they glorified God, and blessed His saints, through the grace and love to man of our Lord Jesus the Christ, to Whom be glory, and His Good Father, and the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever!
Amen.
I, Victor, the least of all men, the deacon, the son of the blessed Mercurius, the deacon of [the church of] Saint Mercurius, the general-in-chief, of the city of Latopolis, wrote this book.
Remember me, O Lord, when Thou comest into Thy kingdom!
. . . by the zeal and care of our fathers and beloved brethren, Abba Abraham, the governor, and Abba Khael, the archdeacon, and the warden Zacharias, deacon and monk of the Monastery of Saint Mercurius, the general-in-chief, which is in the Mountain of Tbo (Edfu, or Utfu).
They made the book with [the proceeds of] their own labour,
and they deposited it in their monastery in order that [the brethren] may read therein, and that those who read therein, and those who hear it read with attention, may profit to the full thereby, and our Good Saviour and Saint Apa Onnophrios, the anchorite, may bless them, and all those who are assembled in their monastery, with the blessing of heaven, and the blessing of earth, in the most complete fulfilment.
May He give blessing, and fullness, and abundance, and lasting salvation in this Monastery.
May He deliver them from the wiles of the Devil and of evil-doing men,
and when they come forth from the body, according to what is ordained for every man, may they hear [the words], 'Well [done], servants good and faithful; since ye have been faithful in a few things, I will set you over many. Enter into the joy of thy Lord.'
 May they be worthy of an inheritance with all the saints. Amen. So be it!
His food consisted of bread and salt only.
And the Devil goaded him with carnal desire, for he wished to make him fall into fornication ;
but this noble Apa Victor vanquished him by means of prayers, and fasting, and by his Christian citizenship.
And his fellow noblemen were always making a mock of him, saying, 'Why dost thou not eat?
Why dost thou not drink?
Why dost thou not wear fine apparel and put on beautiful raiment?
Thou wilt die, and then others will consume thy possessions.'
But he was wont to make answer [unto them], saying, ' Apparel becometh moth-eaten,
gold and silver crumble away,
[and] the beauty of the body becometh destroyed in the tomb.'
And Apa Victor was wont to go into his chamber and to pray unto God in the following manner : ' O Lord, hearken unto me!
(O) Lord Jesus the Christ, Thou knowest the speech of heresy, and (Thou knowest) whether I love Thee or not.
O my Lord Jesus the Christ, permit Thou not the love of women to rise up in my heart, lest Satan find a place of abode in my heart, and lest mine enemies rejoice over me, and lest Thou Thyself become wroth with me, and say unto me in the day of the Judgement of Truth (when) I come into Thy hands, 'Depart thou from Me.'
But let Thy lovingkindness bear patiently with me, and do Thou not remove Thyself from me.
Glory be unto Thee, O Father, Who art in the Son, and unto Thee, O Son, Who art in the Father, and unto Thee, O Holy Spirit, for ever, and ever, and ever! Amen.'
Then Romanus the general said unto Apa Victor, his son, 'My son Victor, it is now thy turn to worship the gods of the Emperor, in whose honour the whole city is keeping this day a feast, especially Apollo, the greatest of the gods.'
And Apa Victor looked into the face of his father, saying, 'O my father, hath this foolishness obtained such a hold upon thee this day as to make thee forsake the God of heaven for the sake of the glory that is vanity?
Remember, therefore, that which our Lord Jesus saith in the Gospel, 'Whosoever denieth Me before men, him will I Myself deny before My Father, Who is in the heavens, and before His holy angels.
Do not therefore deny Him, O my father, that He may not deny thee.
For God gave a commandment unto Moses, saying, 'Speak thou unto the children of Israel, saying, Be ye not like unto the nations who worship creatures instead of Him that created (them).
And lift ye not up your eyes to the heavens, to worship the sun, and the moon, and the stars, when ye see them, and the feathered fowl of the heavens, and the four-footed creatures of the earth, for in that day I will destroy you, saith the Lord,'
Now therefore, O my father, be not thou like unto them, lest God destroy thee.
For it would be better for thee that thou hadst never been born than that, having been born, thou shouldst live and make thyself a man without God.'
And whilst Apa Victor was saying these words all the soldiers of the army were looking on him and on his father.
Then Romanus said, | 'O my son Victor, hearken unto me, and do thou offer up sacrifice, and let us bring to an end our trouble in this place.
Now I have never given thee an occasion to grieve from thy childhood up.
Remember, O my son Victor, that I am seeking after thy bride,
and I am going to take her for thee to wife in the very next month which is coming.
Apa Victor said unto his father, 'I have not asked thee for a bride or for a gift, but I am grieving exceedingly for thee, for thou hast denied the Saviour,
In very truth, O my father, thou art a miserable man,
for the works which thou art doing God hateth.
Now woe and confusion shall come upon thee, because David said, He who is in a battle, and he who carrieth away stuff (or, spoil), the same share appertaineth to both alike.
Moreover, O my father, the man who committeth sin, and the man who is of the same opinion as the man who committeth it, the same disgrace appertaineth to both alike.
I beg thee therefore, by every means, do not this thing, my father.
Get thee away from this sin which leadeth unto death.
Look thou into the Gospel of the Lord, and see that whilst the Jews were crying out, Crucify Jesus, Pilate the Governor took water, and washed his hands
and made himself free from the liability (for His death) among the high priests and the Jews,
and he delivered his soul from death.
And his father was wroth with indignation,
and he swore an oath, saying, ' By Apollo, the greatest of the gods, I will deliver thee over to the Emperor (so that) He may destroy thee.
Dost thou not know that I am well acquainted with the matter wherewith thou art occupied? Thou hast learned to work magic in this Name of Jesus.
Think not, however, O Victor, that he will be able to help thee.
for veFor very many men of thy kind have died for His sake,
and they have been stripped of their worldly goods and of their estates and possessions.
Perhaps thou art grief-stricken because I have not taken for thee to wife thy bride
And Apa Victor answered and said, 'My father, the fruit of the Devil hath taken deep root in thee'
Romanus said unto Apa Victor, 'Knowest thou not, O miserable one, that when a man is disobedient unto his father they put him to death?'
Apa Victor said unto his father, 'Yesterday thou didst worship God and I was thy son; but today I am not thy son, because thou hast made thyself disobedient unto God,
 and thou dost worship idols.'
Truly did Paul the scribe say, 'In the case of a man who is a heretic, if after thou hast admonished him once or twice, and he doth not hearken unto thee, let him alone, for thou knowest that his portion is not with God.'
For this reason thou art not my father.
Roman us said unto him, 'Hearken unto me, O my son Victor.
Do not throw away and waste thine early manhood. And do not disgrace thyself in the midst of the imperial palace, and before the whole of the Emperor's army.
I myself shall be put to shame because of thee, and shall be disgraced before the Emperor and his servants, for thou art setting at naught the law of the Emperors, and thou art shewing thyself to be an ill-educated young man among thy companions. And they will take away from thee thy rations, and the Emperor will be angered because of thee.
But, if thou wilt hearken unto me, I will make an appeal to the Emperor on thy behalf, and he will make thee a general, and thou shalt be a man of dignity and honour in the palace of the Emperor.
Be thou not disobedient to me, O my son.
Dost thou not know that I and thy mother have no other son except thee?
I swear by the health of Apollo that if thy mother were to hear that thy body hath troubled thee during the last few days, she would be able neither to eat, nor to drink, and she would grieve sorely (about) thee.
O my son Victor, I swear by mine own health, that on the day whereon thou wast born to me I made an offering of twenty centenarii of gold to the temple of Apollo. I was bound, deaf,
On the third day after thou wast born to me, I betrothed the daughter of Basileides to thee to wife.
And therefore I swear by thine own health, O my son Victor, that if thou wilt worship the glorious gods of the Emperor, I will make a gift unto thee of another thirty centenarii of gold, in addition to the other things which I have determined to give unto thee.'
Then Basileides and Euaios went to Apa Victor, and they said unto him, ' Verily we come to entreat thee this day as a free man.
Wilt thou then make thyself to be as it were a slave before us?
Why hath thine heart turned its gaze aside in this manner ?
And why hast thou not hearkened to thy father who hath made supplication to thee?
Do not put our hearts to shame, who bow humbly before thee.'
And Apa Vietor became wroth,
and he cried out, saying, ' O God, look Thou with Thine eyes, and with Thine ears hear. As I wish to live, even so do I wish that everyone else may have life with me also.
I have no feeling of envy (or, jealousy) in me.
Behold Thou then, O God, the things which they are doing unto me, and see how they even dare to say unto me, 'Take thou thirty centenarii of gold, and deny Jesus in the midst of this multitude.'
Do they not think that I myself am Judas who betrayed (or, gave away) his Lord for thirty pieces of silver, for which reason he inherited the outer darkness for ever?
 I swear by the prayers of the saints, for I am not worthy to take an oath by the name of God, that if thou wouldst give unto me the whole world, and the kingdom of Diocletian, and his possessions, and his gods of gold and of silver, which he hath made I would not offer up sacrifice.
For it is written, 'If thou shalt gain the whole world, and lose thy soul, what is the profit (to thee)?'
Dost thou not know know that for the last twelve years I have fasted the whole week through, from Sabbath to Sabbath,
and that I have never once washed in a bath?
And when Romanus had heard these things from his son Victor, he said, ' I swear by Apollo that I will deliver thee into the hands of the Emperor, and he shall destroy thee.
Thou dost not know what I know well, that thou art treating the law with contempt; for it is written, 'When a son is disobedient to his father they shall slay him.''
And Apa Victor said unto his father, 'Behold, that which is written is fulfilled this day, 'A father shall deliver his son over to death.'
If thou shalt deliver me over (to death), O my father, there existeth One Who will help me.
Shall not I reward thee with the reward of my Lord?
For when, the Jews were standing before Him, and crying out 'Crucify Him', and were buffeting Him, He did not reward them with evil in place of evil, but He shewed compassion upon them.
And moreover He is shewing mercy and longsuffering towards all this multitude this day, and upon this lawless king I who is carrying out these evil designs in the midst of this city.
And the Devil filled the heart of the father of Apa Victor, and he made him to deliver Apa Victor over into the hands of Diocletian the Emperor
And when the Emperor had looked into the face of Apa Victor, he said unto him
O thou Victor, why hast thou not hearkened to thy father, and worshiped my gods?
Is it possible that thou dost not know that I have absolute power over thee?
And Apa Victor tore off his golden chain, and removed the insignia of his rank which he had on him, and he threw them in the face of Diocletian, saying,
Indeed I am in no way a soldier, and I will not wear the badge of an emperor who is mortal, for I wear the badge of the Emperor who is in the heavens.
For it is written in the book of the Christians,
It is not possible for you to perform the service of two master; (ye must) either (serve God or mammon,
And again, It is not possible for you to eat at the table of the lord, and at the table of the demons.
Now therefore, I will serve the God of heaven, and I will not serve mammon, that is to say, thee, Emperor therefore, I will serve the God of heaven
And the Emperor said unto Apa Victor
How dost thou dare to insult me in this fashion?
Dost thou think that there are no instruments of punishment and torture in the prison-house wherewith I can have thee punished?
Have I not already commanded (or, announced to) thee, saying I not already commanded (or, announced to) thee, saying,
Never let me hear this name of Jesus (issue) from thy mouth?
If it were not that I should inflict shame on thy father I would not permit thee to utter one word in my presence.
Is it possible that thou hast never heard that an Emperor like unto myself gave orders to a governor
who put to death thy Lord Jesus, in whom thou puttest thy confidence? his king was Herod, who gave orders to Pilate and Pilate put Him to death.
Now, if it was a mere governor who slew Jesus thy God, how much more is it possible for me, an Emperor, to destroy this name of Jesus from under heaven, and every one who worshippeth Him?
Now, therefore, O 'Victor, come, hearken to thy father, and do thou offer up sacrifice to the gods.
 If, however, thou wilt not do so, I will banish thee, and they shall put thee to death.
And Romanus turned towards his son Apa Victor and said unto him
 Art thou still not persuaded to pay worship unto the gods of the Emperor?
And Apa Victor said unto his father
If Diocletian be thy god, (good and well); but he is no god of mine, for my Lord is Jesus the Christ.
And his father was exceedingly wroth, and he commanded them to bind his son's arms behind him, and to carry him outside the city, and to spear him there (until) he died.
And they tied the arms of this noble Apa Victor behind him, and they fastened a gag in his mouth so that they might carry him outside (the city) to destroy him; and when he was coming out soldiers accompanied him.
And the Devil took the form of a soldier, and he made himself visible to Victor, and he said unto him
Victor, where wilt thou fulfill this evil course of action?
By these acts of thine thou art abandoning thy father to grief.
Thou thinkest that thy father hateth thee. This is certainly not so, for thy father loveth thee exceedingly.
Now, therefore, hearken thou unto me, and let me tell thy father that thou hast repented, and he will cease to be angry with thee.
Do not, then, do not, I say, be disobedient unto him.
Consider Isaac, the son of Abraham, who shewed no disobedience to his father when he saw the knife of slaughter which was to kill him coming down upon him.
Now, therefore, do not make thy father to grieve, otherwise thou wilt fall under the curse of Ham, who was under the curse of his father, because he looked upon his father's nakedness.
Now, therefore, do not shew disobedience to thy father, and then I will petition the Emperor, and he will make thee a general.
And Apa Victor said unto the Devil
I have not set my mind upon the possession of the rank of general in this world, but upon the kingdom of my Lord Jesus the Christ.
And when these words had been said (by him) they went in and told the Emperor that Romanus had passed sentence of death upon his son, Apa Victor, and that his head was to be cut off, (because) he had sinned against the Emperor and his gods.
And Diocletian sent two (of his) bodyguards so that they might seize him, and bring him to him.
And the Emperor said unto his father
I know this day that thou carest neither for (thy) wife nor (thy) son as much as thou carest for me and my gods, and that thou hast gone so far as to deliver over to death thine only son for my sake. But  hearken unto me and unto the things which I will declare
Hearken unto me
Peradventure this impostor hath led his heart astray. I will banish him to Rakote, and let him he there in prison until he dieth
And Apa Victor was exceedingly wroth, and he said unto the emperor
thou stupid and senseless Emperor this matter which thou seekest to effect is good, (for) thou wilt make thyself a strangers unto us, and we shall become strangers unto thee.
And the greater part of thine army shall hale thee, and God shall he angry with thee, and He shall send His wrath upon thee, and shall destroy thy kingdom
And the Emperor was wroth, and he commanded immediately that (his servants) should reduce his supply of food, hut he did not cut off his rations altogether, and the Emperor allowed him sufficient food to keep him alive lest he should die of hunger.
And he caused him to be deprived of his rank of count.
And he made them to fasten Apa Victor's hands behind him
and he tied him to the tail of a horse
and shaved the crown of his head
and he suspended a bell from his neck
and four soldiers filled their hands with palm branches and beat him therewith, and they dragged him naked round about through all the city, and a herald went before him crying out
These things are done unto this man because he will not offer up sacrifice to the gods of the Emperor
and they went through every part of the city with him.
And on the new moon of Parmoute, the first day of the month of the beginning of the year, according to the computation of the Romans
Diocletian took a sheet of parchment, and wrote on it these words
I, Diocletian, who am the Lord of all the World, write unto Armenius, the Count of Rakote, that so soon as this man Victor, who is banished, is brought unto thee
thou shalt examine him carefully three times
and slialt afterwards drive him to the baths, and burn him.
And straightway they delivered him over into the hands of four soldiers in order that they might take him to Rakote.
There was (an iron) collar round his neck, there was a gag in his mouth, there was fettering iron about his feet, and he was naked, and there were iron casings about his legs, and the soldiers drove him along with blows.
And Apa Victor said unto the soldiers who were in charge of him, ' My brethren, I pray you to cease to treat me with such harshness and  cruelty, and to vex me so seriously
What is the evil thing which I have done unto you, that ye should rejoice over me with such keen pleasure?
I have never done any injury to you, and I have never committed an act of injustice against you.
If the Lord will He can prepare my way of escape, not only from you, but from everybody.
And when his mother had seen him, she was greatly disturbed within herself, and she rose up on her throne, and she said
Is it thou, O my son Victor, thou light of mine eyes?
And when she saw that he was naked, and that he was wearing iron fetters on his hands and on his feet, she said unto him
 Why art thou in this state, O my son Victor?
Truly my soul is greatly disturbed when I see thee in this state.
Art thou mad? Could not the Emperor have adjudged thee (to pay) money, rather than treat thee in this way?
And Apa Victor said unto his mother
Weep thou, my mother, for they are going to remove the name of Victor from thy house this day.
Now, therefore, hearken thou unto me, my mother, and I will declare in thine ears my words which are sweet.
Before every tiling do thou fear God, and do thou glorify His saints.
Keep holy His sabbaths.
Observe the times of fastings.
Neglect neither the widows nor the orphans, for from this day forward I myself shall be an orphan, without father and without mother, so that the lovingkindness which thou shewest in this world will God also shew to some one else.
May lie transfer it to me myself in that other world which I am about to enter, for there is nothing greater than love (i, e. charity).
Visit those who are sick.
Now, therefore, O my mother, I know of a certainty that I shall never have a sight of thee again after this present sight, even if I live. If thou hearest that I have died, seek after my body and bring it to this place.
Make not thyself like I unto my father who hateth (his) son, but be thou compassionate. And do thou ascribe glory unto God by day and by night, so that He may shew compassion unto thee in the days of necessity.
THE INSTRUCTIONS WHICH OUR HOLY FATHER, HE WHO WAS GLORIOUS IN EVERYTHING, THE ARCHIMANDRITE, PRONOUNCED CONCERNING A BROTHER WHO, IN THE TIME OE APA EBONH, WAS STIRRED TO WRATH AGAINST A CERTAIN MAN WHOM HE HAD BROUGHT TO TABENNfiSE.i HE SPAKE THESE WORDS TO HIM, AND THE OTHER FATHERS (WHO WERE) OLD MEN WERE THERE, AND THEY REJOICED EXCEEDINGLY. IN THE PEACE OF GOD!
MAY HIS HOLY BLESSING AND THE BLESSINGS OF ALL THE SAINTS COME UPON US, AND MAY WE ALL BE SAVED! AMEN.
My son, listen. Make thyself wise, and receive the instruction of truth (?).
There are two ways (which thou canst follow).
 Either make thyself independent, (or) hearken unto (i. e. obey) God as did Abraham, who forsook his [native] land, and made himself an exile, and lived in a tent with Isaac in the land of promise as a stranger.
My son, emulate the lives of the saints, and follow closely their virtues in thy life and conversation.
Be thou then long-suffering, so that thou mayest be numbered among the company of the saints 'while you believe that you will receive an imperishable crown
Thoughts? Bear them with long-suffering (or, patience) until God shall give thee rest.
Fasting? Bear it continually with patient endurance.
Prayer? Let it be without ceasing in thy habitation between thee and God.
(Let thy) heart be at one with thy brother.
(Let) virginity be in all thy members,
(let) virginity be in thy thoughts (or, mind)
For gladness goeth with him that is humble, and thou shalt be satisfied with whatsoever thy soul desireth.
For the ways of God are with him that is lowly of heart, and with the humble man.
My son, I command thee to watch and to be sober, and to understand what are the things which lie in wait for thee.
The spirit of sloth and a not unbelieving attitude of mind walk together.
The spirit of lying and the works and the words which are not deceitful walk together.
The spirit of the love of money, and non-trafficking, and not swearing false oaths, and works which are not evil, and envy walk together.
The spirit of vanity and non-greediness (?) walk together.
The spirit of fornication and impurity walk together.
Woe be to that miserable soul wherein these things take up their abode, and make themselves masters of it in such a manner that they drive it away from God
for it getteth out of its own control, and it is tossed about on this side and on that until it arriveth in the Tartarus of Amente.
My son, hearken unto me. Be not thou careless
Give no sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids, so that thou mayest be able to escape like a goat from those who would shear it.
For, O my son, all the spirits from my youth up have on many occasions made me weak,
I came into the desert they used to afflict me to such a degree that my heart failed me, and I thought that there was not strength enough in me to stand up against the threat of the Serpent.
For he used to persecute me on every side
My son, do not use words of abuse to any man, lest peradventure thou mayest see some one paying (the man) honour, and must say, 'This one hath ended (his trouble), he receiveth refreshing.'
Take thou good heed to guard thyself against a thought of this kind, for it is exceedingly; and God I hateth him that payeth Him honour, if he be one who hateth his brother.
And he who shall say concerning himself, 'I am something,' is nothing at all, and he only deceiveth himself; is there any one who can help him?
He who is arrogant, and who maketh his heart like unto the heart of God, saying,
There is no one who can be compared with me,' let him hear now his Creator, saying, 'Thou shalt go down into Amente. They shall cast thee down with the dead, the worms shall gnaw pieces from thy body, and the Worm shall envelop thee.'
The man who hath gotten himself humility judgeth himself, saying,
 My sins are greater than those of every other man' he judgeth no man in any way whatsoever, and he abuseth no man.
Who art thou that thou shouldst judge a slave who doth not belong unto thee ?
My son, keep watch over thyself, and never abuse any man.
Taste thou all the virtues, and guard thou them carefully.
If thou art a stranger, keep to thyself. Rush not into the company of men, and thou shalt not mingle with their works.
Remember Habakkuk in Judea, and Daniel in Chaldea,
though there was a difference between them—for one used to rule in the palace—especially the case of Daniel; when he was down in the pit (and was intended) to become food for the wild beasts,
He prepared a meal for him.
Remember Elijah in the desert, and the widow in Zarephath, who notwithstanding the scourge of famine and the pressure of hunger which weighed heavily upon her, and the helplessness of her old age, never lost heart,
but she contended boldly, and prevailed and obtained the promise of God, and her house enjoyed abundance during the time of the famine.
The giving of bread either in the time of abundance or in (the time of) poverty is not power if thou be once blameworthy through want.
For it is written concerning the saints, 'They suffer want, they are afflicted, they endure tribulation,
but they boast themselves in their troubles.'
If thou dost a contend in patience in the strife of the Scriptures, no servitude whatsoever shall come upon thee, according to that which is, written,
'Do not let yourselves be deceived with eating, and drinking, or with the share at the festival, or with new moons, or with sabbaths, which shall be a covering for the things that take place.'
Meditate thou always on the words of God, endure sufferings patiently, and in everything give thanks.
Flee thou from before the honour of men. Love thou him that revileth thee, in the fear of God.
When thou art seated among the brethren, do not laugh at even the smallest word of scurrility (which thou mayest hear).
Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego disregarded the jeering of Nebuchadnezzar, and for this reason he was unable to compel them (to worship) by the songs and music of his instruments neither was he able to trick them by meals at his table.
And for this reason the flames of fire [of the furnace] which rose up to a height of forty-nine cubits were extinguished. And these men did not go over to the perverse (or, crooked),
but they were upright before Him that is upright, that is to say, God; and for this reason He made them chiefs over their enemies.
And again, Daniel did not hearken unto the conversation of the Chaldeans, which was evil, and for this reason he became a chosen vessel of great value.
And (the lions) fell down, and watched him with intelligent understanding, and he shut the mouths of the savage lions.
Now therefore, O my son, if thou wilt set God before thee as thy hope, He will become a helper unto thee in the hour of thy strife;
for it is right for him that setteth out to go to God to believe that He is, and that this wage (i.e. reward, or prize) shall be to those who seek Him.
These words have been written down for us in order that we may believe in God, and that we, from the least among us even to the greatest, may strive in the contest with fastings, and with prayers, and with other kinds of service, until the spittle drieth in thy mouth through fasting.
And God will not be unmindful of this, but thou shalt find all these again in the hour of thy necessity.
Only do thou humble thyself in everything.
Set thy word behind thee, if thou wouldst have understanding of everything in peace.
man, what wilt thou do in Babylon? Thou wilt commit some disgraceful act in (that) strange land, because thou hast never been put to the test, and thou wilt cast God away from thee willingly.
For this reason, O my brother, do not abandon thy heart.
Thou mayest perhaps forget for a short time
but thine enemies will never sleep, neither will they ever forget, either by night or by day, and they will attribute craft to thee.
For this reason run not thou after greatness, lest thou be humiliated, and thine enemies rejoice over thee;
run after humility, for he that exalteth himself shall be brought low, and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted.
If thou art unable to make thyself independent, cling thou unto some one who doth work in the Gospel of the Christ, and thou shalt go forward with him.
Or do thou obey thyself, or submit thyself, to one who doth obey. Or make thyself to become strong, so that men may call thee Elias, or do thou obey a strong man, so that men may call thee Elisha;
If thou wishest to live in the desert, behold, all the prophets (have done so) before thee;
make thyself like unto them. They spread themselves about in the deserts, and in the ravines of the hills, and in the caverns of the earth, they suffered privations, and they endured tribulations, and afflictions, and pains.
Again He saith, 'The shadows of those who were martyred (?) and the spirlt(s) of the men who endured trial, and suffered tribulation, shall bless Thee.
Moreover, when the thief uttered one word on the cross, God forgave him his sins, and took him into Paradise.
My son, flee thou from the desire of lust, for that it is which produceth the understanding of wickedness.
It will not permit a man to know the mystery of God,
and it will make thee a stranger to the language of the Spirit;
and it will not permit thee to bear the Cross of the Christ,
and it will not permit the heart to breathe the blessings of God.
Keep thou watch against the relaxation of the viscera, which shall make thee a stranger unto the good things of Paradise.
Keep thou watch against the pollution of thy body, which shall provoke to wrath God and His angels.
My son, turn thou to God ; thou shalt love Him, thou shalt flee from the Enemy, whom thou shalt hate, so that the graces of God may be with thee, and thou shalt inherit, as did Judah, the son of Jacob.
My son, be thou long-suffering in everything, for it is written, 'Make haste to make thyself a chosen one of God, a workman who hath no need to be ashamed.'
Set out on thy way to God after the manner of one who soweth and reapeth, and thou shalt enter into thy treasure-house (or, granary) of the good things of God.
Do not turn away the face like the hypocrites, but treat with decision the wishes of thy heart; work for God, and work for thine own salvation.
If the passion of the love of money attack thee, and envy, or hatred, or any one of the other passions, enter into thee, take thou to thyself the heart of the lion, take thou to thyself the heart of the mighty warrior, and do battle with them, and destroy them like Sihon, and Og, and all the kings of the Amorites;
for the beloved Son, the Only-begotten, the King Jesus, fighteth for thee, and thou shalt inherit the city of the enemy.
Only cast out from thyself every kind of pride, and thou shalt be strong.
And observe. When Joshua, (the son) of Nun was bold (or strong), God gave his enemies into his hand.
If thou become timid of heart thou makest thyself a stranger to the law of God.
Timidity of heart filleth thee with excuses for sloth, and unbelief, and carelessness, until thou art destroyed.
Be lion-hearted I Cry out, saying, 'Who shall separate us from the love of God? If thou sayest, ' My outer (man) will perish, (it may be true), but thine inner man will become renewed day by day.
If thou livest in the desert fight by means of prayers, and fastings, and afflictions;
if thou livest among men, be thou wise as the serpents, and harmless as these doves (about) us.
If a man hath struck thee a blow, bear it at his hands, and rejoice ; set thy hope in God, and He will do what is good for thee.
And again He said, 'Blessed are ye when men heap curses on you, and persecute you, and revile your names as (those of) evildoer(s).'
Behold our Fathers Barnabas and Paul, when honour was paid to them they rent their garments, and they wept, hating the glory of men.
And Peter himself, and John, when they had been beaten in the Synagogue came out rejoicing, because they had been held to be worthy of being beaten for the sake of the Holy Name of the Lord, (for) they were hoping for the honour of heaven.
O my son, do thou flee the comfort which is in this world in order that thou mayest enjoy thyself in the world which is to come.
Be not careless, and do not let day after day pass unheeding, or (vices) will overtake thee before thou knowest (it), and thou wilt come into danger wherefrom thou canst not escape, and these foul-faced things will surround thee, and seize thee, and carry thee away with insolent boldness, and they will cast thee into their place of darkness, which is filled with fear and tribulation.
Grieve not if any man insult thee before men, but grieve and sigh when thou committest a sin,
 for this is the true disgrace for thee, to go to the stripes of thy sin.
I command thee, with the greatest earnestness, to hate the glory which is vain.
The armour of the Devil is empty praise, and it was in this way that he led astray Eve.
He said unto her, 'Eat of the tree, for it will open your eyes, and ye shall become like the gods.'
She hearkened and she thought that it was true ; she fled from the glory which was divine,
and there was taken away from her (the glory) of humanity.
And when thou pursuest the glory which is vain, it maketh thee a stranger to the glory of God.
Now therefore, when honour is paid unto thee, abase thy heart thyself, and give glory to God;
and when they revile thee, give glory to God likewise, and give thanks unto Him because thou art held to be worthy of the portion of His Son and His saints.
If they called thy Lord 'The Impostor', and the Prophets vile men', and the others ' madmen ', behold, how much more will they call us by these names who are dust and ashes?
Make unto thyself simplicity (or, innocence). Be thou like unto the simple lambs about us, which when their wool is shorn from them say nothing.
Go not from one place to another, saying, 'I shall find God in this place or in that.'
Know, O my son, that God is in thine interior, so that He may make thee to remain in the law and commandments of God.
Behold, the thief upon the cross went into Paradise.
Behold, Judas himself in the midst of the Apostles betrayed his Lord.
Behold Rahab and her fornication!
She is numbered among the saints.
Behold, Eve, who was deceived, is in Paradise.
Behold, Job on the dung-heap is compared with his God.
Behold, Adam, who transgressed the commandment, is in Paradise.
Behold, the angels of heaven were taken into the abyss (?).
Behold, Elijah and Enoch were taken into the kingdom of the heavens with all glory.
Seek after God, seek ye His face at all times.
Seek thou Him as did Abraham, who obeyed God and offered up his son as a sacrifice unto God,
Who called him My Companion'.
Seek Him like Joseph, who contended against pollution, and at length became king over his enemies.
Seek Him like Moses, who followed his God,
and He made him a lawgiver, and taught him concerning His likeness.
Daniel sought Him, and He taught him great mysteries,
and delivered him from the mouths of the lions.
The Three Holy Men sought Him, and found Him in the furnace of fire.
Job took refuge with Him, and He healed him of his wounds.
Susannah sought Him, and He delivered her out of the hand of the lawless men.
Judith sought Him, and she found Him in the tent of Holophernes.
All these sought Him, and He delivered them, (and) He delivered others also.
As for thee, O my son, how long wilt thou be careless?
What is the limit (?) of thy carelessness?
What it was last year, even so is it this year;
and what it was yesterday, even so is it to-day.
And again, know thou the city of the Christ, and give glory unto Him, because He died for thee.
If it should happen that a brother uttereth some word concerning thee, why shouldst thou become angry, and behave towards him like a wild beast?
And why dost thou not remember that the Christ died for thee?
At the moment when thine enemy, that is to say, the Devil, whispereth unto thee, thou dost incline thine ear to him, and he poureth into it stinkingness, and thou openest thy heart, and dost swallow the venom which he poureth into thee.
O my son, take thou good heed to the words of the wise man Paul, and to that which he spake, saying, 'There are bonds and tribulations awaiting me in Jerusalem,
but I do not value my soul in the very least so that I may complete my course.
And I am ready to die in Jerusalem for the Name of my Lord Jesus, the Christ.'
For neither sufferings nor temptation can prevent the saints from going to the Lord.
Be thou of good cheer then, play the man; what hast thou, to do with the sluggishness of the Devil?
He fleeth before the patient endurance of the saints.
O my son, why dost thou flee from Adonai, the Lord of Sabaoth?
Why dost thou flee to the captivity of the Chaldeans?
Why dost thou give thy heart to eat with the devils?
Guard thou thyself, O my son, from fornication.
Destroy not the member of the Christ.
Do not hearken to the devils, and make the member of the Christ into the member of a whore.
Remember the tribulations and the punishments.
O my son, flee thou to the feet of God, for it is He Who hath created thee, and He suffered for thee.
I gave My back to the stripes of the whips, and My cheeks to the buffetings of insult; I did not turn away My Face from the shame and the spitting.'
O man, the road to Egypt is not for thee, and it is not for thee to make thyself drink water from this Geon (i. e. Nile) which ;is stirred up (i. e. muddy).
These thoughts which are muddy also are not for thee.
Bestir thyself until these sufferings depart (?) from thee.
Moreover, turn thyself, weep for thy sins.
For it is written, ' If ye set yourselves to consider your sins which are in the soul, a seed of a great plant shall appear.'
Therefore thou seest, O man, that transgression is an evil thing, and that sin is wont to produce a multitude of sufferings and punishment.
Do not forsake the Church, which is, as it were, a widow.'
Now when I had heard these words, and when the clergy cried out to me in (my abode),
 I came forth, and I followed them, and I cast all my care upon Jesus, because nothing whatsoever can happen without (the consent of) God.
Now, therefore, ye must know, O my beloved, that that which I say unto you is true, and that also which the wise man Paul said, 'Let not each one take for himself honour, but let it be brought upon him through God.
When Aaron became high priest, it was not he who glorified himself, but He Who spake with him, saying, 'Thou art a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedek' And thus also was it in the case of the Christ, [for God said unto Him], ' This day have I begotten thee
In this wise did Apa Pisentius take his seat upon the episcopal throne with a perfect (heart). And God gave grace unto his face, even as to Joseph.
And no man dared to look into his face without being afraid of the fear of God which rested with him.
Who could take into account the number of the acts of kindness and charity which he did to the poor, and not only to the needy folk of his own province, but also to those who came to him from a distance?
He used to receive them himself, and give unto them whatsoever they asked at his hands.
And ye must know, moreover, that the praises which have been bestowed upon him are far too few, even for the early days of his episcopate, when he began to do acts of charity in every town and village (from Coptos) to Souan (Syene).
The things (i.e. the offerings), which were brought unto him year by year according to the Canons of the Apostles, he was wont to send secretly to certain men who were fearers of God in the various cities, and in the various villages, and they used to distribute it among the poor in the season
Now after a long time during which our holy Father Apa Pisentius had governed his flock with exceedingly great care, he dispatched (copies) of a letter to all the people who were in the province of Kebt (Coptos), and rebuked them, saying, Cease ye to do these great and grievous sins, concerning which we have been informed,
lest peradventure God shall become wroth with you, and shall deliver you over into the hands of the Barbarians who shall afflict you.'
And moreover, he wrote also in that letter, saying, ' Unless ye repent quickly, God shall bring that nation upon you without delay.
And again, after (this he wrote), 'Except ye be instructed, that nation shall not cease to raise up wrath against you.
(It is) a nation fierce of visage and cruel, and shameless in respect of its face; it shall neither spare, nor have compassion on old man or youth;
it shall afflict you with sufferings which shall be as grievous as the plagues of Pharaoh of old, until at length he drove them into the abysses of the sea, thinking to destroy (them) openly.
Therefore let repentance remain with you in your habitations at all times, so that it may be in your hearts, and let fasting increase in your mouth at all times.
For charity shall boast itself over judgement, according to the word of James, the wise man of the Apostles.'
For the third angel in the salvation of God is the Angel of Charity.
For charity shall deliver a man from death, and it will not permit him to go into the darkness.
And moreover, it is very much better to perform acts of charity than to gather in gold.
And thou shalt shew compassion unto him that is in debt to thee.
Let not thine eye be envious of thee whilst thou doest deeds of charity and righteousness.
And moreover, it is better to give a very little with lovingkindness and righteousness than to give a great deal with violence.
And do not thou turn thy face away from any poor man, and God shall not turn away His face from thee.
And again, in respect of the little which one may owe thee, be not afraid to give it in alms, even as the holy man Tobit said.
And consider the case of that rich man who despised Lazarus the poor man, and what was done unto him in the matter of punishment, and how he answered and said in anguish of heart,
 'My father Abraham, let them send Lazarus, and let him dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue therewith, for I am tortured in this fire.' And what he heard was it not words of rebuke?
For Abraham said unto him, 'My son, remember that during thy lifetime thou didst receive thy good things, and Lazarus the things which were bad.'
And now to him do they shew consolation in this place, whilst as for thee, they inflict tortures on thee for thy charity, for they will be as merciful to thee as thou hast been to the poor.
Thou didst feed thyself on young and tender flesh (?), and on small birds, and on other creatures, thou didst eat by thyself the tender plants of the earth, thou didst drink undiluted wine in glasses insatiably and without consideration for any other man.
And as concerning' the man whom thou didst forget, and to whom thou didst shew no charity with that which was thine,
 if there by chance remained to him the smallest amount of any possession, thou wast in the habit of demanding- it from him unjustly.
If thou wouldst not give unto him of the things which were thine own, at least thou mightest have been kind to him, and watched and seen that justice was done to him; thou shouldst not have weighed him down with thine injustice.
For thou knowest that thou and the poor man were made of one and the same kind of clay.
Do not give him cause to grieve, and God will not give thee cause to grieve.
There is a place of judgement wherein each man - shall be judged according to what he hath done, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.'
Behold, these are the things which the God-loving Father Apa Pisentius wrote on many occasions to all the people.
Now how is it possible for us to beautify our encomium of the holy man, except by means of his own mouth?
But let us invoke him, so that he may minister unto us in respect of the remainder of the things which it is seemly for us to narrate in this encomium, according to the measure of our inability.
We are wholly unable to attain to the heights of thy virtue, O thou good ascetic, who art adorned with the virtues of the Holy Spirit, [thou doer of] all the righteous precepts and commandments which are full of life.
Verily if every part of me was to become a tongue I should not be able to do honour to thee in a manner suitable to the ten thousands of virtues which thou dost possess ; and moreover, as for the mite which we are able to cast into the treasury, it is thy grace alone which hath prepared it for us.
For we know well that thou hast no need of our feeble tongue to utter these few words of encomium, because thy citizenship is in the heavens, according to the words of the tongue of sweet odour, that is to say, Paul, (who said), 'As for us, our citizenship is in heaven, the place for which we wait'.
Nevertheless, let us declare a few things concerning the holy man, to the glory of God.
Now it came to pass that at the time when God brought the heathen, that is to say, the Persians, upon us, for our sins, Apa Pisentius departed to the mountain of Djeme, and hid himself in that place because of the Persians.
And my father answered and said unto me, God will not forsake us, O my son, but He will minister unto all our wants.
For He said. Take no care for the morrow, for the morrow will take care for itself.
And again, at the time when Elijah the Tishbite was in the desert, the ravens brought bread unto him every day in the early morning, and again at the time of evening.
And when he had laid himself down and slept under the tree which is called 'rathmen', and had risen up, he found there upon it a loaf of bread and a vessel of water.
And an angel said unto him, 'Arise, eat bread, drink water.'
And Elijah ate the bread, and drank the water, and he journeyed on that road for forty days and forty nights,
Then I answered him, saying, ' I did fall down, and I did go mad, and this is the truth, when thou didst depart into the desert
but now thou hast returned to me once more, and I perceive that thy face is full of joy, and that bright light goeth forth from it, even as from the face of Moses, the Lawgiver,
the natural condition of my mind hath returned to me, and I cease to thirst
And he answered and said unto me, 'He Who supplieth with food the hawks (?) which neither sow nor reap, nor gather grain into garners, He, I say, it is Who hath supplied us with these waters whereof we were in need.
For for him who casteth his care upon Jesus will Jesus care in every place, and He will serve him.'
Therefore, O my beloved, ye must know that wheresoever a man goeth, all his hope must be (set upon) Jesus. And he must remember that which is written in (the Book of) Jeremiah the Prophet, 'Cursed is he whose hope is placed upon man,
but blessed is the man who hath set his heart upon God, and God shall become unto him a hope.
He shall become like a tree which is planted by the waters, and his roots shall not perish for lack of moisture.'
What shall I say, or with what words shall I describe all the glorious virtues of this glorious, and just, and blessed man?
Unto whom shall I compare thee, O blessed man, Apa Pisentius?
I will compare thee unto Abel who was the head of the worshipping of God and of the high-priesthood of God, and who became the first to offer up sacrifices and offerings.
For this reason I ascribe blessing to thy holy fatherhood, because thou didst become a father to the orphans, and the mouth of the widow blesseth thee, O thou holy man and bishop, Apa Pisentius.
All the wise folk that were in the land marvelled at thy wisdom, and they had need of thy advocacy in this world.
and they gave glory to thy worship of God.
Thou didst behave like a nobleman towards those who drew nigh unto thee, and the Greeks ascribed glory unto thee.
Thou didst make to be of no effect the office of the absolute ruler.
Thou didst shut the mouths of the beasts, and the cages for prisoners in the prisons fell into disuse, and possessions returned to their rightful owners.
Thou didst conquer Amalek like Joshua, the son of Nun, and thou didst conquer the Amorite like Israel.
Thou didst put on the whole armour of God,^ and therefore thou wast able to quench all the arrows of the Evil One which blazed with fire, and thou didst do battle against all the crafts of the Devil.
Thou didst lay hold on the breastplate of faith, and thou didst put on thy feet the preparation of the Gospel of peace.
Thy fame hath reached to the boundaries of the inhabited world. Thou wast a wise man in the opinion of Governors, even as was Saint Athanasius, and God gave thee strength in the Scriptures.
And thou didst seek to know in thy mind concerning the world which is to come, and thou didst set out to examine into the depth of the wisdom of God, which is hidden.
Thou wast a man inured to the contemplative life, even as was the holy man Apa Pahomd (Pachomius), the father of the coenobite life.
God raised men to very high positions in thy days, and in thy generation He graciously bestowed upon us His peace
God brought forth thy righteousness like the light, and He made thy judgement to be like the hour of noon.
Thou didst keep the commandments of God, and for this reason thy peace was like unto an overflowing river, and thy righteousness like unto the great and mighty deep.
Unto whom shall I liken thee, O holy hermit, Apa Pisentius, thou faithful priest?
I will liken thee unto Noah, of whose holy sacrifice God smelled (the sweet savour). For thou didst taste that the working was good, and thy lamp was not extinguished during the whole night.
Thou didst make for thyself celestial garments of byssus and purple, and thou didst plant a vineyard of the fruit of thy hand.
Thou wast a righteous man in the worshipping of God with all thy heart and with all thy soul.
God gave unto thee rain from heaven as He did to Elijah.
The things which were bitter He made sweet by means of thy ministrations, even as did Elijah.
The desert places became fertile in thy days, and the hills poured out milk during thy generation.
Thou didst build thy children on the Rock which cannot be moved, that is the Christ, and thou didst build in them the faith (or, belief) which is everlasting.
Thou wast the (place of) repose of the men of Egypt, and a kindly inn for those who were strangers.
Thou becamest a sufferer in the service of the poor, and a help unto those who were tortured with grief.
Thou didst shew thyself perfect in spiritual knowledge. Thou didst take thy rest (or, die) in the midst of thy children, like Jacob,
Thou wast a wise man like Solomon, and thou didst inherit the blessing from God.
Because of this thou didst light upon the paths which were delicate, thou didst make good thy escape, thou didst keep the faith, and thou didst set the crown of righteousness upon thy head.
Thou didst deposit seed for thyself in Sion, O Apa Pisentius, and thou didst beget for thyself a household in the Jerusalem of heaven.
Thou didst receive the sword of the Holy Spirit, through prayers of every kind and through supplications of every kind ; and for this reason thou wast able to gain the mastery over the spirits of evil in the darkness.
Thou didst make thyself to resemble the Sun of righteousness in Whose wings there is healing, and because of this the eyes of thy soul sent forth rays of splendour.
Thou didst build a house for God, even as did Solomon, and thou didst complete the courtyard thereof as did Zerubbabel.
Thou didst walk about in the meadow of the Spirit, and therefore thou didst find in the treasury (or, field) holy mysteries.
Thou wast eager to receive in thy heart, and therefore God gave thee the star of the light of the knowledge of Him.
Thou didst eat of heavenly bread, and thou didst rejoice thyself in the tree of immortality.
Unto whom then shall I liken thee, O thou blessed man, thou great priest, Apa Pisentius?
I will liken thee unto Jacob, whom God remembered in his sufferings, because of his innocency, and gave him the inheritance.
I will liken thee also unto Joseph, unto whom God gave a crown of the kingdom (i.e. a royal crown).
I will liken thee unto Samuel, who (became master) of the gifts of grace of the high-priesthood. I will liken thee unto Samuel who became a priest, unto whom God gave the promise of the priesthood and of the office of prophet when he was a little child.
I will liken thee unto the sons of Jonadab/ who kept the commandments of their father.
I will liken thee unto the Great Apostle, Saint Peter, who stood in archiepiscopal rank.
I will liken thee also unto Paul, who had the care of all the Churches.
I will liken thee also unto Zacharias, the high-priest, whom God filled full of the Holy Spirit.
For God gave thee wisdom out of His mouth, even as He did to Solomon.
The man who went to thee, no matter who he was, with a sorrowful heart, did he not come back rejoicing?
O thou true consoler, according to the words of the Psalmist David, 'Thy words give me life, thy words comfort me.'
each of whom was associated with the throne of priesthood like unto thyself.
Now as concerning the marvellous acts of thy great power which were performed with quietness, no man whatsoever can full tale thereof; but those which we have seen with our eyes, and those which we have heard with our ears that love discourses concerning his power, these, I say, are the things which we will now declare.
And a certain man who lived in a neighbouring country, who was a shepherd and was then pasturing his flock, came into the presence of Apa Pisentius that day, in order that he might receive a blessing at his hand.
Now according to the favourable opportunity afforded by God, the shepherd came into the chamber as soon as he found that the door was opened, and he cast himself down at the feet of Apa Pisentius whilst the clergy who had been sent by the Patriarch Damianus were with him.
Then I John, the disciple of Apa Pisentius, laid hold of the man, and I cast him forth.
And when we had gone a little way outside the door, I enquired of him, saying, ' What hast thou been doing to-day to cause the great man to be so angry with thee?
And the shepherd answered and said, ' How did it happen that I did not die this day when I rose up from my sleep?
Now it came to pass that, whilst I was pasturing my sheep to-day among the thorn bushes, a woman passed me on the road whom I knew.
And I laid hold upon her in the foolishness of my heart, and I lay with her, thinking that the great man would never know anything about it.
But, by God, Who is the witness of my soul, immediately he looked at me, the consciousness sprang up in me that he knew what I had done.
And a mighty pain smote me at once in all my body, and I came nigh falling on my face, and I should have done so if it had not been that thou didst seize me, and bring me out by the door.
It (i.e. his look) made me powerless, and I was about to fall upon my face.'
Then that shepherd brought several cheeses in wicker baskets, and he said unto me, ' I entreat thee to take these few cheeses from my hands, and to send them to these men who are with thee in thy house ; since I have brought them, be not grieved at me.'
Then I answered and said unto him, ' I will not take them without the knowledge of the great man, lest if he find it out he scold me.'
And that shepherd answered and said unto me, 'I conjure thee by God Almighty to take them from my hands, and to give them to the poor on my behalf.*
Now when I heard (him mention) the awful Name of God, I felt afraid, and I took them from his hands on account of the oath (which he had sworn) by God.
And I carried them and put them down along with the other cheeses which had been brought unto me that day.
And I said in my heart, 'I will not let the great man know about my act at all'
And it came to pass at the hour of evening that day, that when the time for repose and meditation had come, he (i. e. Apa Pisentius) rose up in order that he might give some cheese to the clergy.
Would not every man who saw him rebuke him, saying, Why is it since God hath given light to thine eyes that thou lovest to adopt the guise of the blind men who walk in darkness at all times?
Verily (even if thou hast to sit up) until midnight thou shalt not sleep in this place until thou hast given them to him.'
Then I said unto Apa Pisentius, 'Forgive me, O my father.
When I had thrown him out of the door, he swore mighty oaths to me, and I was afraid of the oath which he swore in (the Name of) God, and I took the cheeses from him.'
And Apa Pisentius answered and said, 'Do not attempt to anoint my head with the oil of the sinner.
I departed therefore and I gave the cheeses to him on the evening of that same day, and I returned to my place according to the advice of my holy father.
Now ye must know that our righteous father Apa Pisentius was inspired by the Holy Spirit, and he was a righteous man, and if (ye imagine) that he was not, hearken ye unto the following narrative, and ye will assuredly be struck with wonder.
Now it came to pass again on a certain day that my lord and father sent me on a message, which was urgent, to a certain district of Djeme.
Now it was very late in the day when I started to come back, and before I could get back it was dark night.
and they fled as soon as ever they heard the name of the great man, Apa Pisentius.
And when I had journeyed on a little further,
And it came to pass that after her barbarian husband was dead the woman remained in that country. And after (many) days those pagan people among whom the wife of Eustathius was living rose up (or, rebelled), and advanced to seize the country of the Romans.
And the Emperor Trajan was greatly troubled because of the war with these pagan peoples, and he remembered Plaketas, more especially because of his bravery and his numerous defeats of the alien peoples.
And the remembrance of Eustathius kept stirring within him,
and he was troubled about the change which had come upon him in his affairs.
Then he prepared himself and the soldiers who were in his kingdom for the war.
And he grieved exceedingly for Plaketas,
and he spake, saying, ' Him who shall give me such indication as will help me to find him, upon him will I bestow a great honour and a yearly wage, and I will make him exceedingly rich.'
And two of his soldiers—now the name of one of them was Antiochus, and that of the other Aeacius, and they had been servants of Eustathius, and untiring in their ministrations to him in times past when he was living with them—
departed to seek after him, and they searched the whole kingdom through very thoroughly until they arrived at the village wherein Eustathius was.
And as they were going along in. the place wherein Eustathius was keeping watch he saw them from a distance,
and he recognized them by their peculiar carriage, and by their gait.
And he remembered his former manner of life, and he began to feel sorrowful in heart,
and he prayed, saying, 'O Lord God, Thou merciful One, Who deliverest every one who putteth his hope in Thee, since I have seen those who formerly walked with me shall not I have hope?
Now, therefore, give the command, and look upon me and upon Thy servant, that is to say, my wife.
For I know well that because of my own evil works my children have become food for wild beasts, but I entreat Thee to permit me to look upon (them) again in the Resurrection.'
And whilst Eustathius was saying these words he heard a voice which spake unto him, saying, 'Be of good cheer, O Eustathius, at this time,
for thou shalt again have the position which thou hadst formerly, and thou shalt receive thy wife and thy children.
In the resurrection of the dead thou shalt see the good things which are for ever.
Do not deny Me, and thou shalt find a rest which is endless, and thy name shall increase from generation to generation.'
And when he had heard these words Eustathius was afraid, and he walked down from the place where he was,
and he stood up close to where the two soldiers were on the road in front of them,
and he knew them without any doubt, but they did not know him.
They said unto him, 'Hail, good neighbour!'
And he said unto them, 'Peace be unto you, O my brethren!'
They said unto him, 'Dost thou know in this place a man who is a stranger, and is called Plaketas, and his wife, and his children?
If thou canst shew us this man we will give unto thee very much money.'
And Eustathius said unto them, 'For what purpose art thou enquiring after him?'
And they said unto him, 'He was a fellow soldier, and behold, we have been wishing to meet him for many years past.'
And he said unto them, 'I know not the man.
Rest ye, however, with me, for the day is far spent ; rest ye yourselves with me in this Replace which I inhabit.
For I myself am a stranger.'
And he took them into his house,
and then departed to buy some wine to give them to drink.
And he said unto the master of the house wherein he lodged, ' I know these men.
They have come to me here that I may supply them with food and wine ; and they would rest (i.e. lodge) with me in this place. (Give me food and wine) and I will repay thee the price of the same at the time when my wages (are paid)
and the man gave unto him joyfully everything which he needed.
And Eustathius remained and ministered unto them, and he could hardly contain himself when he remembered his former life; nevertheless he kept a strong- hold upon himself, and did not weep,
but he went out (of the house) and wept. And he washed his face,
and went into (the house again), and served them.
And they looked at him, and little by little they began to recognize him, and they spake unto each other, saying, 'This man is like unto the man whom we are seeking;
and the one said unto the other, 'Yea, he is like him. I know that there was a scar on his neck which was caused by a wound which he received in it a long time ago during the war with the Masekates.
Let us watch him carefully so that we may see whether he hath the scar or not.
If he hath the scar on his neck then he is the man.'
And having watched for the sig-n very carefully they saw the mark of the wound on his neck,
and straig-htway they rushed to him, and they kissed him,
and they asked him, saying, 'Art thou not the man Plaketas who was formerly a great general?'
And he denied it, saying, 'Certainly not'; and he kept a strong hold upon himself so that he might not weep.
And when they had pointed out to him the scar of the wound on his neck, they took an oath to him, saying, ' Thou art Plaketas, the general'; and they asked him concerning his wife and his children.
And he said unto them, 'They are dead.'
And whilst he was talking to them about these matters they lifted up their faces with a great cry, and they wept so loudly that all the people who were in the village heard them;
and whilst they were uttering these loud cries the people of the village came to see what had happened, and they were afraid and were greatly moved.
And the soldiers quieted their uproar, and described to them the power and honour which the man had enjoyed formerly.
And when the men of the village had heard these things they heaved sighs, and said, 'Great is the honour of this man who hath become a hireling unto us.'
Then the soldiers reported the matter to the Emperor. And they arrayed Eustathius in good apparel, being such things as they had with them, and they took him
and they took him and set out on their road.
And every one who was in the village walked with him to set him on his way,
and (when) he had supplicated them he sent them away.
And whilst he was travelling along the road with the soldiers he described unto them the things which he had seen (in the thicket), and how he had seen the Christ, and also how he had been named Eustathius,
and he told them about all the things which had happened unto him. And when they had fulfilled fifteen days in marching on the road they came to the place where the Emperor Trajan was,
and they shewed unto him in what manner they had discovered Plaketas.
And Trajan the Emperor came forth to meet him, and he kissed him, and he wept many tears,
and he enquired of him what his reason was for his departure.
And Eustathius related to Trajan and all the nobles what had happened unto him, and the history of his wife and his children
and in what way the captain of the ship had carried away his wife by force, and how his children had been carried off by wild beasts, and he described to them their tribulations.
And there was very great joy indeed in (the hearts of the Emperor and his nobles) because they had found Eustathius alive. And the Emperor comforted him, and made him a general as he had been aforetime.
And when Eustathius had inspected the army he knew that it was not sufficiently strong to fight in battle against the Barbarians,
and he shewed the Emperor that this was so.
And Trajan the Emperor commanded his officers to enlist recruits,
and he wrote an epistle to every city wlierein he ordered the people thereof to enlist men, and to train them, and to make them fit to be used as soldiers.
And it came to pass that when (the envoys) had entered the villag-e wherein were the sons of Eustathius they took the two young men and made recruits of them.
And the men who were in that place bore testimony concerning them, and said that they were vigorous in respect of their strength, and goodly in their appearance.
And when Eustathius had gathered together all the recruits, and had assigned to them their positions, he perceived that the two young men were the most goodly of them all.
And he appointed them to serve him personally, because he knew that they were of noble birth by their manners and habits,
and in his good nature he set them apart to minister unto himself. And their own natural disposition drew them more and more day by day to make him love them,
and he gave orders that they were to eat with him at his table.
And after these things he took command of the army according to his wont,
and he departed to the war and to the country of the Barbarians, which he had taken before that day,
and in which he had set free those who had been kept in captivity therein.
And he crossed the river which is called Hydaspes, and went up over the mountains, and penetrated far into the country of the Barbarians,
and he vanquished the foreigners also, and spoiled the whole country.
And Eustathius took counsel with some of the pagans, and it seemed good to the Providence of God to make him to enter the place where his wife was.
Now this woman had, from the very first, been preserved, even as I have already said, through the care of God, from the violence of the captain of the ship (and of other) masters.
And when this foreigner died she went away by herself, and she took up her abode in the garden of one of the people with whom she lodged,
and she made a booth wherein she might live by herself.
And when the general had taken that town, and had spoiled it, he pitched his camp there for a period of three days, and rested there with his army, because that place was very suitable for encamping in.
And it came to pass that the two young men took up their abode in that garden wherein the booth of their mother was situated.
And as it was the season of noon they sat down and discussed together the affairs of their childhood, but they did not know that their mother was in that place, nor did they know what had happened to them.
And their mother was sitting listening to what they were saying.
And the elder brother said unto the younger brother, 'As concerning the time of my childhood I cannot remember anything at all except that my father was a general, and that my mother was a very beautiful woman, and that they had two children.
One of them was younger than myself, and his hair was red, and his face was handsome.
And they took us, and they came forth from our house one night,
and they embarked with us in a ship wherein we sailed I know not whither.
And when we arrived at the shore on the ship my mother remained by herself on the ship, though for what purpose I know not. As for us our father took the two of us away, and he went on his way weeping.
And having come to a river he swam across it with my little brother,
and me he left on the bank of the stream.
And when he would have returned to carry me over a lion sprang upon me and seized me with his jaws, and went off with me into the desert.
Now certain shepherds who were pasturing their flocks in that place snatched me from the lion, and they brought me up there.
This I do know, but I do not know what happened to my little brother and to my father.'
When the younger brother heard these things from his elder brother he leaped up and wept, and he said, 'Thou art my brother.
For from what thou hast said I know that thou art my lord brother, because I myself was brought by the shepherds who told me that I had been snatched away from the claws of the wolf;
and he embraced him, and they kissed each other.
And as their mother was listening to these thing's she knew that the two young men were her sons by what they had said about her voyage on the ship.
And she said within herself, 'I wonder can these young men be my sons or not?
Can my sons possibly have their forms?'
And she was exceedingly sorrowful, and her bowels were greatly moved when she saw the young men embracing each other and weeping.
And she continued to gaze upon them, and she said, 'These assuredly are my sons, more especially because they said that their father was a general, and that their mother remained on the ship.'
And on the morrow she went to the general and spake unto him, saying, 'I beseech thee (to hear me), O my lord ; I am a woman from the country of the Romans, and I was carried away captive, and they brought me to this place.
I therefore entreat thee to take me back to my native land.'
And whilst she was saying these things she began to recognize in him her husband through the various characteristic marks which she knew to be in him ; and when she had recognized him she was afraid to question him.
And when she was unable any longer to contain herself she cast herself down (before) him, saying, ' I beseech thee, O my lord, be not angry with me,
for I wish thee to make known unto me what thy rank in life was formerly.
Now I think that thou wast Plaketas, the general, who changed his name, and who was called Eustathius, after thou hadst been baptized in the Name of the Christ Jesus, Who did appear unto thee with an animal that was without reasoning power,
And when thou hadst fallen into the trials which the Lord had previously indicated to thee thou didst take thy wife, that is to say, myself, and thy two sons, that is to say, Agapius and Theopistus,
and didst set out for Egypt. And when we had come to the sea we embarked in a ship, and we set sail, and made our passage, and when we had arrived
thou didst punish me through the savage captain of the ship,
who seized me and carried me off to his native land. But, as the Lord Jesus the Christ is my witness, neither that man nor any other hath defiled my body, but have guarded my chastity until this day.
If now thou art Enstathius, as I know thou must be judging by the marks which I can describe unto thee, I conjure thee by the might of the Christ to declare thyself, and not to hide from me anything whatsoever.'
And when Eustathius had heard these things he marvelled exceedingly.
And when he had looked into her face, and recognized her, a mighty joy came upon him.
And he rose up straightway, and embraced her, and said unto her, 'I am Eustathius of whom thou speakest.' And they kissed each other with a spiritual kiss,
and they shed tears in great abundance, and they glorified God Who at all times doeth good things for His servants, and bringeth them out of all tribulation.
And his wife said unto him, 'Where are my sons?'
And he said unto her, and he wept as he said it, 'The wild beasts carried them off'; and he told her what had happened unto them (when they were) with him.
And she said unto him, ' Let us give thanks unto the Lord, for even as He hath given us each to the other, so will He speedily give unto us our sons.'
And Eustathius said unto her, 'I tell thee again that the wild beasts carried them off.'
And she answered and said, 'Whilst I was sitting in the garden yesterday I heard two young men talking together about the events which happened in their early childhood, and they related things which concerned their early years.
And I knew that they were my sons, but they would never have recognized one another had it not been that the words which the elder brother spake supplied the clue that enabled the younger brother to recognize him.
And they declared unto him the things which had happened to them, and immediately he recognized that they were in truth his sons,
and he embraced them with fervour, and he kissed them.
And Eustathius and his wife cast themselves on the necks of their sons,
and they wept long and gave thanks unto God for the marvellous manner in which they had met one another again.
And the rumour of that which had befallen them reached all the multitude of the city,
and all the people gathered together in one place, and they marvelled and rejoiced because Eustathius and his wife and sons had met together once more, but more
 especially for the victory over the Barbarians. And they made a great feast that day because they had met together (again),
And he, because of his valour, whereof he was conscious, and because of his meeting with his wife and sons, was filled to the uttermost with his joy.
And when he had come into the city the Emperor went and entered into the temple of Apollo, but Eustathius did not go in with him, and remained outside.
And the Emperor called him, and asked him why he did not come into the temple of Apollo, (saying), 'Thou must pour out a libation to the gods in return for thy victory, and because thou hast returned from the war, and thou must offer up sacrifices of thanksgiving to them, especially as thou hast found thy wife and thy sons.'
Now, therefore, I know no other god besides Him.
For He is the God Who hath created the heaven and the earth, and it is He alone Who hath done these great marvels.'
Then the Emperor was wroth when he heard these things from Eustathius,
and he made him to withdraw from him as if he had been a pagan, he and his wife and his sons,
and he spake unto them words of terror and threats of destruction.
And the saints neither regarded them nor were they frightened at all.
And when the Emperor saw this great sight, and that the wild beast would not attack them, he fell into doubt.
And he commanded them to make a brazen bull, so that they might cast the saints into it and burn them.
And the multitude gathered together to see the strife, and the spectacle of the saints
and (the servants of the Emperor) seized them with the mechanical contrivances of the instrument for lifting them up into it.
And the blessed Eustathius entreated the honourable people to allow them to pray,
and he spread out his hands, he and his wife and his sons,
and they prayed, saying, 'O Lord God of the Powers, Whom no man hath ever seen, but Whom now we see according to His wish, hearken Thou now unto us who cry unto Thee. Make Thou our prayer to be perfect with one thought, namely, the confession of Thy Name and Thy holy faith.
In this manner do Thou receive us nnto Thyself, through this fire, as a sacrifice well pleasing unto Thee, and because we make ourselves to be also an offering by fire.
And Lord, do Thou grant a favour and a gift unto our bodies, so that every one who shall commemorate us shall receive a gift in the kingdom of heaven, and also a time of rest upon earth.
And if those who are in peril on the sea, or by waters of any kind, cry unto Thy Holy Name, do Thou deliver them from their danger.
And if those who are (burdened) with manifold sins cast themselves down before Thee in Thy Name, do Thou forgive them their sins. And to every one who shall commemorate us on the day (called after) our name, be Thou, O Lord, a helper.
Let the threat of the fire which is round about us become unto us the dew of refreshing, so that our bodies, O Lord, may gain strength thereby.'
And whilst they were saying these words and were praying they heard a voice from heaven, saying, ' Inasmuch as ye have been mighty athletes in this life,
and ye have endured patiently manifold trials, fear ye not at this present, and come ye into this place in peace. Ye shall receive an indestructible crown,
and ye shall enjoy yourselves with the good thing's which have been prepared for you for ever, in the place of the suffering's that ye have endured, and the trials which ye have borne patiently and which were only for a time.'
And when the saints had heard these things they delivered themselves joyfully over to the soldiers, who cast them into the brazen instrument.
And having been thrown in the flame of fire enveloped them, and they ascribed glory unto the Holy Trinity, unto Whom victory belongeth,
and after a short time they delivered up their souls into the hands of God. And the fire did not touch (or, scorch) their bodies in the least degree, nor the hair of their heads.
And after three days the wdcked Emperor Hadrian came to the place wherein the saints had finished (their fight),
And when the evening had come the Christians came and carried away the bodies of the martyred saints, and they laid them in an honourable place secretly in the city of Rome.
Such is the history of the life and contest of these blessed and holy martyrs, that is to say, Apa Eustathius, and Apa Agapius and Apa Theopistus, his sons, and Amma Theopiste, his wife.
Here endeth the account of their strife.
Now every one who shall be worthy to celebrate the holy commemoration (of these saints), and who shall invoke them, shall receive the good things of the kingdom which is in the heavens, through the grace and love for man of our Lord Jesus the Christ, to Whom be glory, and to His Good Father, and to the Holy Spirit, for ever and ever.
Amen.
And there was a man of the sons of Benjamin, and his name was Kis, the son of Abiel, the son of Jared, the son of Bachir, the son of Aphec, the son of a Benjamite, a man of might.
And this man had a son, and his name was Saul, of great stature, a goodly man; and there was not among the sons of Israel a goodlier than he, high above all the people from his shoulders and upward.
And the asses of Kis the father of Saul were lost; and Kis said to Saul his son, Take with thee one of the young men, and arise ye, and go seek the asses.
And they went through mount Ephraim, and they went through the land of Selcha, and found them not: and they passed through the land of Segalim, and they were not there: and they passed through the land of Jamin, and found them not.
And when they came to Siph, then Saul said to his young man that was with him, Come and let us return, lest my father leave the asses, and take care for us.
And the young man said to him, Behold now, there is a man of God in this city, and the man is of high repute; all that he shall speak will surely come to pass: now then let us go, that he may tell us our way on which we have set out.
And Saul said to his young man that was with him, Lo, then, we will go; but what shall we bring the man of God? for the loaves are spent out of our vessels, and we have nothing more with us that belongs to us to bring to the man of God.
And the young man answered Saul again, and said, Behold, there is found in my hand a fourth part of a shekel of silver; and thou shalt give it to the man of God, and he shall tell us our way.
Now before time in Israel every one in going to enquire of God said, Come and let us go to the seer; for the people beforetime called the prophet, the seer.
And Saul said to his servant, Well said, come and let us go: and they went to the city where the man of God was.
As they went up the ascent to the city, they find damsels come out to draw water, and they say to them, Is the seer here?
And the virgins answered them, and they say to them, He is: behold, he is before you: now he is coming to the city, because of the day, for to-day there is a sacrifice for the people in Bama.
As soon as ye shall enter into the city, so shall ye find him in the city, before he goes up to Bama to eat; for the people will not eat until he comes in, for he blesses the sacrifice, and afterwards the guests eat; now then go up, for ye shall find him because of the holiday.
And they go up to the city; and as they were entering into the midst of the city, behold, Samuel came out to meet them, to go up to Bama.
And the Lord uncovered the ear of Samuel one day before Saul came to him, saying,
At this time to-morrow I will send to thee a man out of the land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be ruler over my people Israel, and he shall save my people out of the hand of the Philistines; for I have looked upon the humiliation of my people, for their cry is come unto me.
And Samuel looked upon Saul, and the Lord answered him, Behold the man of whom I spoke to thee, this one shall rule over my people.
And Saul drew near to Samuel into the midst of the city, and said, Tell me now which is the house of the seer?
And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am he: go up before me to Bama, and eat with me to-day, and I will send thee away in the morning, and I will tell thee all that is in thine heart.
And concerning thine asses that have been lost now these three days, care not for them, for they are found. And to whom does the excellency of Israel belong? does it not to thee and to thy father's house?
And Saul answered and said, Am not I the son of a Benjamite, the least tribe of the people of Israel? and of the least family of the whole tribe of Benjamin? and why hast thou spoken to me according to this word?
And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them to the inn, and set them there a place among the chief of those that were called, about seventy men.
And Samuel said to the cook, Give me the portion which I gave thee, which I told thee to set by thee.
Now the cook had boiled the shoulder, and he set it before Saul; and Samuel said to Saul, Behold that which is left: set before thee, an eat; for it is set thee for a testimony in preference to the others; take of it: and Saul ate with Samuel on that day.
And he went down from Bama into the city; and they prepared a lodging for Saul on the roof, and he lay down.
An it came to pass when the morning dawned, that Samuel called Saul on the roof, saying, Rise up, and I will dismiss thee. And Saul arose, and he and Samuel went out.
As they went down to a part of the city, Samuel said to Saul, Speak to the young man, and let him pass on before us; and do thou stand as to-day, and hearken to the word of God.
Sing to the Lord a new song: his praise is in the assembly of the saints.
Let Israel rejoice in him that made him; and let the children of Sion exult in their king.
Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sings praises to him with timbrel and psaltery.
For the Lord takes pleasure in his people; and will exalt the meek with salvation.
The saints shall rejoice in glory; and shall exult on their beds.
The high praises of God shall be in their throat, and two-edged swords in their hands;
to execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments among the peoples;
to bind their kings with fetters, and their nobles with manacles of iron; to execute on them the judgment written: this honour have all his saints.
These things says the man to them that trust in God; and I cease.
For I am the most simple of all men, and there is not in me the wisdom of men.
God has taught me wisdom, and I know the knowledge of the holy.
Who has gone up to heaven, and come down? who has gathered the winds in his bosom? who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? who has dominion of all the ends of the earth? what is his name? or what is the name of his children?
For all the words of God are tried in the fire, and he defends those that reverence him.
Add not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be made a liar.
Two things I ask of thee; take not favour from me before I die.
Remove far from me vanity and falsehood: and give me not wealth or poverty; but appoint me what is needful and sufficient:
lest I be filled and become false, and say, Who sees me? or be poor and steal, and swear vainly by the name of God.
Deliver not a servant into the hands of his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be utterly destroyed.
A wicked generation curse their father, and do not bless their mother.
A wicked generation judge themselves to be just, but do not cleanse their way.
A wicked generation have lofty eyes, and exalt themselves with their eyelids.
A wicked generation have swords for teeth and jaw-teeth as knives, so as to destroy and devour the lowly from the earth, and the poor of them from among men.
The horse-leech had three dearly-beloved daughters: and these three did not satisfy her; and the fourth was not contented so as to say, Enough.
The grave, and the love of a woman, and the earth not filled with water; water also and fire will not say, It is enough.
The eye that laughs to scorn a father, and dishonours the old age of a mother, let the ravens of the valleys pick it out, and let the young eagles devour it.
Moreover there are three things impossible for me to comprehend, and the fourth I know not:
the track of a flying eagle; and the ways of a serpent on a rock; and the paths of a ship passing through the sea; and the ways of a man in youth.
Such is the way of an adulterous woman, who having washed herself from what she has done, says she has done nothing amiss.
By three thing the earth is troubled, and the fourth it cannot bear:
if a servant reign; or a fool be filled with food;
or if a maid-servant should cast out her own mistress; and if a hateful woman should marry a good man.
And there are four very little things upon the earth, but these are wiser than the wise:
the ants which are weak, and yet prepare their food in summer;
the rabbits also are a feeble race, who make their houses in the rocks.
The locusts have no king, and yet march orderly at one command.
And the eft, which supports itself by its hands, and is easily taken, dwells in the fortresses of kings.
And there are three things which go well, and a fourth which passes along finely.
A lion's whelp, stronger than all other beasts, which turns not away, nor fears any beast;
and a cock walking in boldly among the hens, and the goat leading the herd; and a king publicly speaking before a nation.
If thou abandon thyself to mirth, and stretch forth thine hand in a quarrel, thou shalt be disgraced.
Milk out milk, and there shall be butter, and if thou wing one's nostrils there shall come out blood: so if thou extort words, there will come forth quarrels and strifes.
And Isaac having called for Jacob, blessed him, and charged him, saying, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of the Chananites.

And behold I am with thee to preserve thee continually in all the way wherein thou shalt go; and I will bring thee back to this land; for I will not desert thee, until I have done all that I have said to thee.
And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and said, The Lord is in this place, and I knew it not.
And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If the Lord God will be with me, and guard me throughout on this journey, on which I am going, and give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on,
and bring me back in safety to the house of my father, then shall the Lord be for a God to me.
And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, shall be to me a house of God; and of all whatsoever thou shalt give me, I will tithe a tenth for thee.
Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.
Many have sinned for a small matter; and he that seeketh for abundance will turn his eyes away.
As a nail sticketh fast between the joinings of the stones; so doth sin stick close between buying and selling.
Unless a man hold himself diligently in the fear of the Lord, his house shall soon be overthrown.
As when one sifteth with a sieve, the refuse remaineth; so the filth of man in his talk.
The furnace proveth the potter's vessels; so the trial of man is in his reasoning.
The fruit declareth if the tree have been dressed; so is the utterance of a conceit in the heart of man.
Praise no man before thou hearest him speak; for this is the trial of men.
If thou followest righteousness, thou shalt obtain her, and put her on, as a glorious long robe.
The birds will resort unto their like; so will truth return unto them that practise in her.
As the lion lieth in wait for the prey; so sin for them that work iniquity.
The discourse of a godly man is always with wisdom; but a fool changeth as the moon.
If thou be among the indiscreet, observe the time; but be continually among men of understanding.
The discourse of fools is irksome, and their sport is the wantonness of sin.
The talk of him that sweareth much maketh the hair stand upright; and their brawls make one stop his ears.
The strife of the proud is bloodshedding, and their revilings are grievous to the ear.
Whoso discovereth secrets loseth his credit; and shall never find friend to his mind.
Love thy friend, and be faithful unto him: but if thou betrayest his secrets, follow no more after him.
For as a man hath destroyed his enemy; so hast thou lost the love of thy neighbour.
As one that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou let thy neighbour go, and shalt not get him again
Follow after him no more, for he is too far off; he is as a roe escaped out of the snare.

These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the desert towards the west near the Red Sea, between Pharan Tophol, and Lobon, and Aulon, and the gold works.
It is a journey of eleven days from Choreb to mount Seir as far as Cades Barne.
And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, according to all things which the Lord commanded him for them:
after he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon, and Og the king of Basan who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain;
beyond Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying,
The Lord your God spoke to us in Choreb, saying, Let it suffice you to have dwelt so long in this mountain.
Turn ye and depart and enter into the mountain of the Amorites, and go to all that dwell near about Araba, to the mountain and the plain and to the south, and the land of the Chananites near the sea, and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.
Behold, God has delivered the land before you; go in and inherit the land, which I sware to your fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and to their seed after them.
And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able by myself to bear you.
The Lord your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye are to-day as the stars of heaven for multitude.
The Lord God of your fathers add to you a thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you.
How shall I alone be able to bear your labour, and your burden, and your gainsayings?
Take to yourselves wise and understanding and prudent men for your tribes, and I will set your leaders over you.
And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast told us is good to do.
So I took of you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over you as rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and officers to your judges.
And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear causes between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.
Thou shalt not have respect to persons in judgment, thou shalt judge small and great equally; thou shalt not shrink from before the person of a man, for the judgment is God's; and whatsoever matter shall be too hard for you, ye shall bring it to me, and I will hear it.
And I charged upon you at that time all the commands which ye shall perform.
And we departed from Choreb, and went through all that great wilderness and terrible, which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God charged us, and we came as far as Cades Barne.
And I said to you, Ye have come as far as the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God gives to you:
behold, the Lord your God has delivered to us the land before you: go up and inherit it as the Lord God of your fathers said to you; fear not, neither be afraid.
And ye all came to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them go up to the land for us; and let them bring back to us a report of the way by which we shall go up, and of the cities into which we shall enter.
And the saying pleased me: and I took of you twelve men, one man of a tribe.
And they turned and went up to the mountain, and they came as far as the valley of the cluster, and surveyed it.
And they took in their hands of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good which the Lord our God gives us.
Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the words of the Lord our God.
And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us.
Whither do we go up? and your brethren drew away your heart, saying, It is a great nation and populous, and mightier than we; and there are cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the sons of the giants.
And I said to you, Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them;
the Lord your God who goes before your face, he shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that he wrought for you in the land of Egypt;
and in this wilderness which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite; how the Lord thy God will bear thee as a nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which ye have gone until ye came to this place.
And in this matter ye believed not the Lord our God,
who goes before you in the way to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, shewing you the way by which ye go, and a cloud by day.
And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware, saying,
Not one of these men shall see this good land, which I sware to their fathers,
except Chaleb the son of Jephonne, he shall see it; and to him I will give the land on which he went up, and to his sons, because he attended to the things of the Lord.
And the Lord was angry with me for your sake, saying, Neither shalt thou by any means enter therein.
Joshua the son of Naue, who stands by thee, he shall enter in there; do thou strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.
And every young child who this day knows not good or evil, they shall enter therein, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it.
And ye turned and marched into the wilderness, in the way by the Red Sea.
And ye answered and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God; we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord our God has commanded us: and having taken every one his weapons of war, and being gathered together, ye went up to the mountain.
And the Lord said to me, Tell them, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight, for I am not with you; thus shall ye not be destroyed before your enemies.
And I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken to me; and ye transgressed the commandment of the Lord; and ye forced your way and went up into the mountain.
And the Amorite who dwelt in that mountain came out to meet you, and pursued you as bees do, and wounded you from Seir to Herma.
And ye sat down and wept before the Lord our God, and the Lord hearkened not to your voice, neither did he take heed to you.
In those days, and at that time, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together; they shall proceed, weeping as they go, seeking the Lord their God.
They shall ask the way till they come to Sion, for that way shall they set their face; and they shall come and flee for refuge to the Lord their God; for the everlasting covenant shall not be forgotten.
My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds thrust them out, they caused them to wander on the mountains: they went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting-place.
All that found them consumed them: their enemies said, Let us not leave them alone, because they have sinned against the Lord: he that gathered their fathers had a pasture of righteousness.
Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon, and from the land of the Chaldeans, and go forth, and be as serpents before sleep.
For, behold, I stir up against Babylon the gatherings of nations out of the land of the north; and they shall set themselves in array against her: thence shall she be taken, as the dart of an expert warrior shall not return empty.
And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be satisfied.
Because ye rejoiced, and boasted, while plundering mine heritage; because ye exulted as calves in the grass, and pushed with the horn as bulls.
Your mother is greatly ashamed; your mother that bore you for prosperity is confounded: she is the last of the nations, desolate,
by reason of the Lord's anger: it shall not be inhabited, but it shall be all a desolation; and every one that passes through Babylon shall scowl, and they shall hiss at all her plague.
Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare not your arrows,
and prevail against her: her hands are weakened, her bulwarks are fallen, and her wall is broken down: for it is vengeance from God: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do to her.
Utterly destroy seed out of Babylon, and him that holds a sickle in time of harvest: for fear of the Grecian sword, they shall return every one to his people, and every one shall flee to his own land.
Israel is a wandering sheep; the lions have driven him out: the king of Assyria first devoured him, and afterward this king of Babylon has gnawed his bones.
Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will take vengeance on the king of Babylon, and upon his land, as I took vengeance on the king of Assyria.
And I will restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and on mount Ephraim and in Galaad, and his soul shall be satisfied.
In those days, and at that time, they shall seek for the iniquity of Israel, and there shall be none; and for the sins of Juda, and they shall not be found: for I will be merciful to them that are left
For the end, a Psalm of David. O God, pass not over my praise in silence;
for the mouth of the sinner and the mouth of the crafty man have been opened against me: they have spoken against me with a crafty tongue.
And they have compassed me with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
Instead of loving me, they falsely accused me: but I continued to pray.
And they rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set thou a sinner against him; and let the devil stand at his right hand.
When he is judged, let him go forth condemned: and let his prayer become sin.
Let his days be few: and let another take his office of overseer.
Let his children be orphans, and his wife a widow.
Let his children wander without a dwelling-place, and beg: let them be cast out of their habitations.
Let his creditor exact all that belongs to him: and let strangers spoil his labours.
Let him have no helper; neither let there be any one to have compassion on his fatherless children.
Let his children be given up to utter destruction: in one generation let his name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Let them be before the Lord continually; and let their memorial be blotted out from the earth.
Because he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the needy and poor man, and that to slay him that was pricked in the heart.
He loved cursing also, and it shall come upon him; and he took not pleasure in blessing, so it shall be removed far from him.
Yea, he put on cursing as a garment, and it is come as water into his bowels, and as oil into his bones.
Let it be to him as a garment which he puts on, and as a girdle with which he girds himself continually.
This is the dealing of the Lord with those who falsely accuse me, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
But thou, O Lord, Lord, deal mercifully with me, for thy name's sake: for thy mercy is good.
Deliver me, for I am poor and needy; and my heart is troubled within me.
I am removed as a shadow in its going down: I am tossed up and down like locusts.
My knees are weakened through fasting, and my flesh is changed by reason of the want of oil.
I became also a reproach to them: when they saw me they shook their heads.
Help me, O Lord my God; and save me according to thy mercy.
And let them know that this is thy hand; and that thou, Lord, hast wrought it.
Let them curse, but thou shalt bless: let them that rise up against me be ashamed, but let thy servant rejoice.
Let those that falsely accuse me be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their shame as with a mantle.
I will give thanks to the Lord abundantly with my mouth; and in the midst of many I will praise him.
For he stood on the right hand of the poor, to save me from them that persecute my soul.
Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a calf or a sheep, in which there is a blemish, or any evil thing; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
And if there should be found in any one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee, a man or a woman who shall do that which is evil before the Lord thy God, so as to transgress his covenant,
and they should go and serve other gods, and worship them, the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which he commanded thee not to do,
and it be told thee, and thou shalt have enquired diligently, and, behold, the thing really took place, this abomination has been done in Israel;
then shalt thou bring out that man, or that woman, and ye shall stone them with stones, and they shall die.
He shall die on the testimony of two or three witnesses; a man who is put to death shall not be put to death for one witness.
And the hand of the witnesses shall be upon him among the first to put him to death, and the hand of the people at the last; so shalt thou remove the evil one from among yourselves.
And if a matter shall be too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, and between cause and cause, and between stroke and stroke, and between contradiction and contradiction, matters of judgment in your cities;
then thou shalt arise and go up to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days, and they shall search out the matter and report the judgment to thee.
And thou shalt act according to the thing which they shall report to thee out of the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt observe to do all whatsoever shall have been by law appointed to thee.
Thou shalt do according to the law and to the judgment which they shall declare to thee: thou shalt not swerve to the right hand or to the left from any sentence which they shall report to thee.
And the man whosoever shall act in haughtiness, so as not to hearken to the priest who stands to minister in the name of the Lord thy God, or the judge who shall preside in those days, that man shall die, and thou shalt remove the evil one out of Israel.
And all the people shall hear and fear, and shall no more commit impiety.
And when thou shalt enter into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, and shalt inherit it and dwell in it, and shalt say, I will set a ruler over me, as also the other nations round about me;
thou shalt surely set over thee the ruler whom the Lord God shall choose: of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a ruler; thou shalt not have power to set over thee a stranger, because he is not thy brother.
For he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall by no means turn the people back to Egypt, lest he should multiply to himself horses; for the Lord said, Ye shall not any more turn back by that way.
And he shall not multiply to himself wives, lest his heart turn away; and he shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.
And when he shall be established in his government, then shall he write for himself this repetition of the law into a book by the hands of the priests the Levites;
and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord thy God, and to keep all these commandments, and to observe these ordinances:
that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, that he depart not from the commandments on the right hand or on the left; that he and his sons may reign long in his dominion among the children of Israel.
And when the kings of the Amorites on the other side of Jordan, who were in the mountain country, and in the plain, and in all the coast of the great sea, and those who were near Antilibanus, and the Chettites, and the Chananites, and the Pherezites, and the Evites, and the Amorites, and the Gergesites, and the Jebusites, heard of it,
they came all together at the same time to make war against Joshua and Israel.
And all Israel, and their elders, and their judges, and their scribes, passed on one side and on the other, before the ark; and the priests and the levites took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the stranger and the native were there, who were half of them near mount Gebal, as Moses the servant of the Lord commanded at first, to bless the people.
And Noemin had a friend an acquaintance of her husband, and the man was a mighty man of the kindred of Elimelech, and his name was Booz.
And Ruth the Moabitess said to Noemin, Let me go now to the field, and I will glean among the ears behind the man with whomsoever I shall find favour: and she said to her, Go, daughter.
And she went; and came and gleaned in the field behind the reapers; and she happened by chance to come on a portion of the land of Booz, of the kindred of Elimelech.
And, behold, Booz came from Bethleem, and said to the reapers, The Lord be with you: and they said to him, The Lord bless thee.
And Booz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose is this damsel?
And his servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabitish damsel who returned with Noemin out of the land of Moab.
And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather among the sheaves after the reapers: and she came and stood from morning till evening, and rested not even a little in the field.
And Booz said to Ruth, Hast thou not heard, my daughter? go not to glean in another field; and depart not thou hence, join thyself here with my damsels.
Let thine eyes be on the field where my men shall reap, and thou shalt go after them: behold, I have charged the young men not to touch thee: and when you shalt thirst, then thou shalt go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men shall have drawn.
And she fell upon her face, and did reverence to the ground, and said to him, How is it that I have found grace in thine eyes, that thou shouldest take notice of me, whereas I am a stranger?
And Booz answered and said to her, It has fully been told me how thou hast dealt with thy mother-in-law after the death of thy husband; and how thou didst leave thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy birth, and camest to a people whom thou knewest not before.
The Lord recompense thy work; may a full reward be given thee of the Lord God of Israel, to whom thou hast come to trust under his wings.
And she said, Let me find grace in thy sight, my lord, because thou hast comforted me, and because thou hast spoken kindly to thy handmaid, and behold, I shall be as one of thy servants.
And Booz said to her, Now it is time to eat; come hither, and thou shalt eat of the bread, and thou shalt dip thy morsel in the vinegar: and Ruth sat by the side of the reapers: and Booz handed her meal, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left.
And she rose up to glean; and Booz charged his young men, saying, Let her even glean among the sheaves, and reproach her not.
And do ye by all means carry it for her, and ye shall surely let fall for her some of that which is heaped up; and let her eat, and glean, and rebuke her not.
So she gleaned in the field till evening, and beat out that she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barely.
And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned, and Ruth brought forth and gave to her the food which she had left from what she had been satisfied with.
And her mother-in-law said to her, Where hast thou gleaned to-day, and where hast thou wrought? blessed be he that took notice of thee. And Ruth told her mother-in-law where she had wrought, and said, The name of the man with whom I wrought to-day is Booz.
And Noemin said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed is he of the Lord, because he has not failed in his mercy with the living and with the dead: and Noemin said to her, The man is near akin to us, he is one of our relations.
And Ruth said to her mother-in-law, Yea, he said also to me, Keep close to my damsels, until the men shall have finished all my reaping.
And Noemin said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is well, daughter, that thou wentest out with his damsels; thus they shall not meet thee in another field.
And Ruth joined herself to the damsels of Booz to glean until they had finished the barley-harvest and the wheat-harvest.
As dew in harvest, and as rain in summer, so honour is not seemly for a fool.
As birds and sparrows fly, so a curse shall not come upon any one without a cause.
As a whip for a horse, and a goad for an ass, so is a rod for a simple nation.
Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou become like him.
Yet answer a fool according to his folly, lest he seem wise in his own conceit.
He that sends a message by a foolish messenger procures for himself a reproach from his own ways.
As well take away the motion of the legs, as transgression from the mouth of fools.
He that binds up a stone in a sling, is like one that gives glory to a fool.
Thorns grow in the hand of a drunkard, and servitude in the hand of fools.
All the flesh of fools endures much hardship; for their fury is brought to nought.
As when a dog goes to his own vomit, and becomes abominable, so is fool who returns in his wickedness to his own sin. [There is a shame that brings sin: and there is a shame that is glory and grace.]
I have seen a man who seemed to himself to be wise; but a fool had more hope than he.
A sluggard when sent on a journey says, There is a lion in the ways, and there are murderers in the streets.
As a door turns on the hinge, so does a sluggard on his bed.
A sluggard having hid his hand in his bosom, will not be able to bring it up to his mouth.
A sluggard seems to himself wiser than one who most satisfactorily brings back a message.
As he that lays hold of a dog's tail, so is he that makes himself the champion of another's cause.
As those who need correction put forth fair words to men, and he that first falls in with the proposal will be overthrown;
so are all that lay wait for their own friends, and when they are discovered, say, I did it in jest.
With much wood fire increases; but where there is not a double-minded man, strife ceases.
A hearth for coals, and wood for fire; and railing man for the tumult of strife.
The words of cunning knaves are soft; but they smite even to the inmost parts of the bowels.
Silver dishonestly given is to be considered as a potsherd: smooth lips cover a grievous heart.
A weeping enemy promises all things with his lips, but in his heart he contrives deceit.
Though thine enemy intreat thee with a loud voice, consent not: for there are seven abominations in his heart.
He that hides enmity frames deceit: but being easily discerned, exposes his own sins in the public assemblies.
He that digs a pit for his neighbour shall fall into it: and he that rolls a stone, rolls it upon himself.
A lying tongue hates the truth; and an unguarded mouth causes tumults.
And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a blossom shall come up from his root:
and the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness shall fill him;
the spirit of the fear of God. He shall not judge according to appearance, nor reprove according to report:
but he shall judge the cause of the lowly, and shall reprove the lowly of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he destroy the ungodly one.
And he shall have his loins girt with righteousness, and his sides clothed with truth.
And the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the young calf and bull and lion shall feed together; and a little child shall lead them.
And the ox and bear shall feed together; and their young shall be together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.
And an infant shall put his hand on the holes of asps, and on the nest of young asps.
And they shall not hurt, nor shall they at all be able to destroy any one on my holy mountain: for the whole world is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as much water covers the seas.
And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall arise to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust, and his rest shall be glorious.
And it shall be in that day, that the Lord shall again shew his hand, to be zealous for the remnant that is left of the people, which shall be left by the Assyrians, and that from Egypt, and from the country of Babylon, and from Ethiopia, and from the Elamites, and from the rising of the sun, and out of Arabia.
And he shall lift up a standard for the nations, and he shall gather the lost ones of Israel, and he shall gather the dispersed of Juda from the four corners of the earth.
And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, and Juda shall not afflict Ephraim.
And they shall fly in the ships of the Philistines: they shall at the same time spoil the sea, and them that come from the east, and Idumea: and they shall lay their hands on Moab first; but the children of Ammon shall first obey them.
And the Lord shall make desolate the sea of Egypt; and he shall lay his hand on the river with a strong wind, and he shall smite the seven channels, so that men shall pass through it dry-shod.
And there shall be a passage for my people that is left in Egypt: and it shall be to Israel as the day when he came forth out of the land of Egypt.
They that trust in the Lord shall be as mount Sion: he that dwells in Jerusalem shall never be moved.
The mountains are round about her, and so the Lord is round about his people, from henceforth and even for ever.
For the Lord will not allow the rod of sinners to be upon the lot of the righteous; lest the righteous should stretch forth their hands to iniquity.
Do good, O Lord, to them that are good, and to them that are upright in heart.
But them that turn aside to crooked ways the Lord will lead away with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall be upon Israel.
Shall not my soul be subjected to God? for of him is my salvation.
For he is my God, and my saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved very much.
How long will ye assault a man? ye are all slaughtering as with a bowed wall and a broken hedge.
They only took counsel to set at nought mine honour: I ran in thirst: with their mouth they blessed, but with their heart they cursed. Pause.
Nevertheless do thou, my soul, be subjected to God; for of him is my patient hope.
For he is my God and my Saviour; my helper, I shall not be moved.
In God is my salvation and my glory: he is the God of my help, and my hope is in God.
Hope in him, all ye congregation of the people; pour out your hearts before him, for God is our helper. Pause.
But the sons of men are vain; the sons of men are false, so as to be deceitful in the balances; they are all alike formed out of vanity.
Trust not in unrighteousness, and lust not after robberies: if wealth should flow in, set not your heart upon it.
God has spoken once, and I have heard these two things, that power is of God;
and mercy is thine, O Lord; for thou wilt recompense every one according to his works.
And David again gathered all the young men of Israel, about seventy thousand.
And David arose, and went, he and all the people that were with him, and some of the rulers of Juda, on an expedition to a distant place, to bring back thence the ark of God, on which the name of the Lord of Host who dwells between the cherubs upon it is called.
And they put the ark of the Lord on a new waggon, and took it out of the house of Aminadab who lived on the hill, and Oza and his brethren the sons of Aminadab drove the waggon with the ark.
And his brethren went before the ark.
And David and the children of Israel were playing before the Lord on well-tuned instruments mightily, and with songs, and with harps, and with lutes, and with drums, and with cymbals, and with pipes.
And they come as far as the threshing floor of Nachor: and Oza reached forth his hand to the ark of God to keep it steady, and took hold of it; for the ox shook it out of its place.
And the Lord was very angry with Oza; and God smote him there: and he died there by the ark of the Lord before God.
And David was dispirited because the Lord made a breach upon Oza; and that place was called the breach of Oza until this day.
And David feared the Lord in that day, saying, How shall the ark of the Lord come in to me?
And David would not bring in the ark of the covenant of the Lord to himself into the city of David: and David turned it aside into the house of Abeddara the Gethite.
And the ark of the Lord lodged in the house of Abeddara the Gethite three months, and the Lord blessed all the house of Abeddara, and all his possessions.
And it was reported to king David, saying, The Lord has blessed the house of Abeddara, and all that he has, because of the ark of the Lord. And David went, and brought up the Ark of the Lord from the house of Abeddara to the city of David with gladness.
And there were with him bearing the ark seven bands, and for a sacrifice a calf and lambs.
And David sounded with well-tuned instruments before the Lord, and David was clothed with a fine long robe.
And David and all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting, and with the sound of a trumpet.
And it came to pass as the ark arrived at the city of David, that Melchol the daughter of Saul looked through the window, and saw king David dancing and playing before the Lord; and she despised him in her heart.
And they bring the ark of the Lord, and set it in its place in the midst of the tabernacle which David pitched for it: and David offered whole-burnt-offerings before the Lord, and peace-offerings.
And David made an end of offering the whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and blessed the people in the name of the Lord of Hosts.
And he distributed to all the people, even to all the host of Israel from Dan to Bersabee, both men and women, to every one a cake of bread, and a joint of meat, and a cake from the frying-pan: and all the people departed every one to his home.
And David returned to bless his house. And Melchol the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and saluted him, and said, How was the king of Israel glorified to-day, who was to-day uncovered in the eyes of the handmaids of his servants, as one of the dancers wantonly uncovers himself!
And David said to Melchol, I will dance before the Lord. Blessed be the Lord who chose me before thy father, and before all his house, to make me head over his people, even over Israel: therefore I will play, and dance before the Lord.
And I will again uncover myself thus, and I will be vile in thine eyes, and with the maid-servants by whom thou saidst that I was not had in honour.
And Melchol the daughter of Saul had no child till the day of her death.
Now then ye did not send me hither, but God; and he hath made me as a father of Pharao, and lord of all his house, and ruler of all the land of Egypt.
Hasten, therefore, and go up to my father, and say to him, These things saith thy son Joseph; God has made me lord of all the land of Egypt; come down therefore to me, and tarry not.
Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaks to you.
Report, therefore, to my father all my glory in Egypt, and all things that ye have seen, and make haste and bring down my father hither.
And he fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept on him; and Benjamin wept on his neck.
And Israel said, It is a great thing for me if Joseph my son is yet alive. I will go and see him before I die.
Hear the word of the Lord, ye children of Israel: for the Lord has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.
Cursing, and lying, and murder, and theft, and adultery abound in the land, and they mingle blood with blood.
Therefore shall the land mourn, and shall be diminished with all that dwell in it, with the wild beasts of the field, and the reptiles of the earth, and with the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea shall fail:
that neither any one may plead, nor any one reprove another; but my people are as a priest spoken against.
Therefore they shall fall by day, and the prophet with thee shall fall: I have compared thy mother unto night.
My people are like as if they had no knowledge: because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt not minister as priest to me: and as thou has forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children.
According to their multitude, so they sinned against me: I will turn their glory into shame.
They will devour the sins of my people, and will set their hearts on their iniquities.
And the priest shall be as the people: and I will avenge on them their ways, and I will recompense to them their counsels.
And they shall eat, and shall not be satisfied: they have gone a-whoring, and shall by no means prosper: because they have left off to take heed to the Lord.
The heart of my people has gladly engaged in fornication and wine and strong drink.
They asked counsel by means of signs, and they reported answer to them by their staves: they have gone astray in a spirit of whoredom, and gone grievously a-whoring from their God.
They have sacrificed on the tops of the mountains, and on the hills they have sacrificed under the oak and poplar, and under the shady tree, because the shade was good: therefore your daughters shall go a-whoring, and your daughters-in-law shall commit adultery.
And I will not visit upon your daughters when they shall commit fornication, nor your daughters-in-law when they shall commit adultery: for they themselves mingled themselves with harlots, and sacrificed with polluted ones, and the people that understood not entangled itself with a harlot.
But thou, O Israel, be not ignorant, and go ye not, men of Juda, to Galgala; and go not up to the house of On, and swear not by the living Lord.
For Israel was maddened like a mad heifer: now the Lord will feed them as a lamb in a wide place.
Ephraim, joined with idols, has laid stumbling-blocks in his own way.
He has chosen the Chananites: they have grievously gone a-whoring: they have loved dishonour through her insolence.
Thou art a blast of wind in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their altars.
And an angel of the Lord went up from Galgal to the place of weeping, and to Baethel, and to the house of Israel, and said to them, Thus says the Lord, I brought you up out of Egypt, and I brought you into the land which I sware to your fathers; and I said, I will never break my covenant that I have made with you.
And ye shall make no covenant with them that dwell in this land, neither shall ye worship their gods; but ye shall destroy their graven images, ye shall pull down their altars: but ye hearkened not to my voice, for ye did these things.
And I said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be for a distress to you, and their gods shall be to you for an offence.
And it came to pass when the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.
And they named the name of that place Weepings; and they sacrificed there to the Lord.
And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his inheritance, to inherit the land.
And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived many days with Joshua, as many as knew all the great work of the Lord, what things he had wrought in Israel.
And Joshua the son of Naue, the servant of the Lord, died, a hundred and ten years old.
And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Thamnathares, in mount Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaas.
And all that generation were laid to their fathers: and another generation rose up after them, who knew not the Lord, nor yet the work which he wrought in Israel.
And the children of Israel wrought evil before the Lord, and served Baalim.
And they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and walked after other gods, of the gods of the nations round about them; and they worshipped them.
And they provoked the Lord, and forsook him, and served Baal and the Astartes.
And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and he gave them into the hands of the spoilers, and they spoiled them; and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, and they could not any longer resist their enemies,
among whomsoever they went; and the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the Lord spoke, and as the Lord sware to them; and he greatly afflicted them.
And the Lord raised up judges, and the Lord save them out of the hands of them that spoiled them: and yet they hearkened not to the judges,
for they went a whoring after other gods, and worshipped them; and they turned quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked to hearken to the words of the Lord; they did not so.
And because the Lord raised them up judges, so the Lord was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved at their groaning by reason of them that besieged them and afflicted them.
And it came to pass when the judge died, that they went back, and again corrupted themselves worse than their fathers to go after other gods to serve them an to worship them: they abandoned not their devices nor their stubborn ways.
And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and said, Forasmuch as this nation has forsaken my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice,
therefore I will not any more cast out a man of the nations before their face, which Joshua the son of Naue left in the land. And the Lord left them,
to prove Israel with them, whether they would keep the way of the Lord, to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or no.
Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to pieces, their graven images are gone to the wild beasts and the cattle: ye take them packed up as a burden to the weary, exhausted, hungry, and at the same time helpless man;
who will not be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led away captive.
Hear me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel, who are borne by me from the womb, and taught by me from infancy, even to old age:
I am he; and until ye shall have grown old, I am he: I bear you, I have made, and I will relieve, I will take up and save you.
To whom have ye compared me? see, consider, ye that go astray.
They that furnish gold out of a purse, and silver by weight, will weigh it in a scale, and they hire a goldsmith and make idols, and bow down, and worship them.
They bear it upon the shoulder, and go; and if they put it upon its place, it remains, it cannot move: and whosoever shall cry to it, it cannot hear; it cannot save him from trouble.
Remember ye these things, and groan: repent, ye that have gone astray, return in your heart;
and remember the former things that were of old: for I am God, and there is none other beside me,
telling beforehand the latter events before they come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, all my counsel shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned:
calling a bird from the east, and from a land afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought him; I have created and made him; I have brought him, and prospered his way.
Hearken to me, ye senseless ones, that are far from righteousness:
I have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory.
But if I had gone with scorners, and if too my foot has hasted to deceit:
(for I am weighed in a just balance, and the Lord knows my innocence:)
if my foot has turned aside out of the way, or if mine heart has followed mine eye, and if too I have touched gifts with my hands;
then let me sow, and let others eat; and let me be uprooted on the earth.
If my heart has gone forth after another man's wife, and if I laid wait at her doors;
then let my wife also please another, and let my children be brought low.
For the rage of anger is not to be controlled, in the case of defiling another man's wife.
For it is a fire burning on every side, and whomsoever it attacks, it utterly destroys.
And if too I despised the judgment of my servant or my handmaid, when they pleaded with me;
what then shall I do if the Lord should try me? and if also he should at all visit me, can I make an answer?
Were not they too formed as I also was formed in the womb? yea, we were formed in the same womb.
But the helpless missed not whatever need they had, and I did not cause the eye of the widow to fail.
And if too I ate my morsel alone, and did not impart of it to the orphan;
And if too I overlooked the naked as he was perishing, and did not clothe him;
and if the poor did not bless me, and their shoulders were not warmed with the fleece of my lambs;
if I lifted my hand against an orphan, trusting that my strength was far superior to his:
let them my shoulder start from the blade-bone, and my arm be crushed off from the elbow.
For the fear of the Lord constrained me, and I cannot bear up by reason of his burden.
If I made gold my treasure, and if too I trusted the precious stone;
and if too I rejoiced when my wealth was abundant, and if too I laid my hand on innumerable treasures:
(do we not see the shining sun eclipsed, and the moon waning? for they have not power to continue:)
and if my heart was secretly deceived, and if I have laid my hand upon my mouth and kissed it:
let this also then be reckoned to me as the greatest iniquity: for I should have lied against the Lord Most High.
And if too I was glad at the fall of mine enemies, and mine heart said, Aha!
let then mine ear hear my curse, and let me be a byword among my people in my affliction.
And if too my handmaids have often said, Oh that we might be satisfied with his flesh; (whereas I was very kind:
for the stranger did not lodge without, and my door was opened to every one that came:)
or if too having sinned unintentionally, I hid my sin;
(for I did not stand in awe of a great multitude, so as not to declare boldly before them:) and if too I permitted a poor man to go out of my door with an empty bosom:
(Oh that I had a hearer,) and if I had not feared the hand of the Lord; and as to the written charge which I had against any one,
I would place it as a chaplet on my shoulders, and read it.
And if I did not read it and return it, having taken nothing from the debtor:
If at any time the land groaned against me, and if its furrows mourned together;
and if I ate its strength alone without price, and if I too grieved the heart of the owner of the soil, by taking aught from him:
then let the nettle come up to me instead of wheat, and a bramble instead of barley. And Job ceased speaking.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Go in to Pharao: for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants, that these signs may come upon them; in order
that ye may relate in the ears of your children, and to your children's children, in how many things I have mocked the Egyptians, and my wonders which I wrought among them; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.
And Moses and Aaron went in before Pharao, and they said to him, These things saith the Lord God of the Hebrews, How long dost thou refuse to reverence me? Send my people away, that they may serve me.
But if thou wilt not send my people away, behold, at this hour to-morrow I will bring an abundance of locusts upon all thy coasts.
And they shall cover the face of the earth, and thou shalt not be able to see the earth; and they shall devour all that is left of the abundance of the earth, which the hail has left you, and shall devour every tree that grows for you on the land.
And thy houses shall be filled, and the houses of thy servants, and all the houses in all the land of the Egyptians; things which thy fathers have never seen, nor their forefathers, from the day that they were upon the earth until this day. And Moses turned away and departed from Pharao.
And the servants of Pharao say to him, How long shall this be a snare to us? send away the men, that they may serve their God; wilt thou know that Egypt is destroyed?
And they brought back both Moses and Aaron to Pharao; and he said to them, Go and serve the Lord your God; but who are they that are going with you?
And Moses said, We will go with the young and the old, with our sons, and daughters, and sheep, and oxen, for it is a feast of the Lord.
And he said to them, So let the Lord be with you: as I will send you away, must I send away you store also? see that evil is attached to you.
Not so, but let the men go and serve God, for this ye yourselves seek; and they cast them out from the presence of Pharao.
And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out thine hand over the land of Egypt, and let the locust come up on the land, and it shall devour every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which the hail left.
And Moses lifted up his rod towards heaven, and the Lord brought a south wind upon the earth, all that day and all that night: the morning dawned, and the south wind brought up the locusts,
and brought them up over all the land of Egypt. And they rested in very great abundance over all the borders of Egypt. Before them there were not such locusts, neither after them shall there be.
And they covered the face of the earth, and the land was wasted, and they devoured all the herbage of the land, and all the fruit of the trees, which was left by the hail: there was no green thing left on the trees, nor on all the herbage of the field, in all the land of Egypt.
And Pharao hasted to call Moses and Aaron, saying, I have sinned before the Lord your God, and against you;
pardon therefore my sin yet this time, and pray to the Lord your God, and let him take away from me this death.
And Moses went forth from Pharao, and prayed to God.
And the Lord brought in the opposite direction a strong wind from the sea, and took up the locusts and cast them into the Red Sea, and there was not one locust left in all the land of Egypt.
And the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he did not send away the children of Israel.
And the Lord said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand to heaven, and let there be darkness over the land of Egyptdarkness that may be felt.
And Moses stretched out his hand to heaven, and there was darkness very black, even a storm over all the land of Egypt three days.
And for three days no man saw his brother, and no man rose up from his bed for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in all the places where they were.
And Pharao called Moses and Aaron, saying, Go, serve the Lord your God, only leave your sheep and your oxen, and let your store depart with you.
And Moses said, Nay, but thou shalt give to us whole burnt-offerings and sacrifices, which we will sacrifice to the Lord our God.
And our cattle shall go with us, and we will not leave a hoof behind, for of them we will take to serve the Lord our God: but we know not in what manner we shall serve the Lord our God, until we arrive there.
But the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he would not let them go.
And Pharao says, Depart from me, beware of seeing my face again, for in what day thou shalt appear before me, thou shalt die.
And Moses says, Thou hast said, I will not appear in thy presence again.
Fret not thyself because of evil-doers, neither be envious of them that do iniquity.
For they shall soon be withered as the grass, and shall soon fall away as the green herbs.
Hope in the Lord, and do good; and dwell on the land, and thou shalt be fed with the wealth of it.
Delight thyself in the Lord; and he shall grant thee the requests of thine heart.
Disclose thy way to the Lord, and hope in him; and he shall bring it to pass.
And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thy judgment as the noon-day.
Submit thyself to the Lord, and supplicate him: fret not thyself because of him that prospers in his way, at the man that does unlawful deeds.
ease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself so as to do evil.
For evil-doers shall be destroyed: but they that wait on the Lord, they shall inherit the land.
And yet a little while, and the sinner shall not be, and thou shalt seek for his place, and shalt not find it.
But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight themselves in the abundance of peace.
The sinner will watch for the righteous, and gnash his teeth upon him.
But the Lord shall laugh at him: for he foresees that his day will come.
Sinners have drawn their swords, they have bent their bow, to cast down the poor and needy one, and to slay the upright in heart.
Let their sword enter into their own heart, and their bows be broken.
A little is better to the righteous than abundant wealth of sinners.
For the arms of sinners shall be broken; but the Lord supports the righteous.
The Lord knows the ways of the perfect; and their inheritance shall be for ever.
They shall not be ashamed in an evil time; and in days of famine they shall be satisfied.
For the sinners shall perish; and the enemies of the Lord at the moment of their being honoured and exalted have utterly vanished like smoke.
The sinner borrows, and will not pay again: but the righteous has compassion, and gives.
For they that bless him shall inherit the earth; and they that curse him shall be utterly destroyed.
The steps of a man are rightly ordered by the Lord: and he will take pleasure in his way.
When he falls, he shall not be ruined: for the Lord supports his hand.
I was once young, indeed I am now old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his seed seeking bread.
He is merciful, and lends continually; and his seed shall be blessed.
Turn aside from evil, and do good; and dwell for ever.
For the Lord loves judgment, and will not forsake his saints; they shall be preserved for ever: the blameless shall be avenged, but the seed of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
But the righteous shall inherit the earth, and dwell upon it for ever.
The mouth of the righteous will meditate wisdom, and his tongue will speak of judgment.
The law of his God is in his heart; and his steps shall not slide.
The sinner watches the righteous, and seeks to slay him.
But the Lord will not leave him in his hands, nor by any means condemn him when he is judged.
Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are destroyed, thou shalt see it.
I saw the ungodly very highly exalting himself, and lifting himself up like the cedars of Libanus.
Yet I passed by, and lo! he was not: and I sought him, but his place was not found.
Maintain innocence, and behold uprightness: for there is a remnant to the peaceable man.
But the transgressors shall be utterly destroyed together: the remnants of the ungodly shall be utterly destroyed.
But the salvation of the righteous is of the Lord; and he is their defender in the time of affliction.
And the Lord shall help them, and deliver them: and he shall rescue them from sinners, and save them, because they have hoped in him.
If Balac should give me his house full of silver and gold, I shall not be able to transgress the word of the Lord to make it good or bad by myself; whatsoever things God shall say, them will I speak.
And now, behold, I return to my place; come, I will advise thee of what this people shall do to thy people in the last days.
And he took up his parable and said, Balaam the son of Beor says, the man who sees truly says,
hearing the oracles of God, receiving knowledge from the Most High, and having seen a vision of God in sleep; his eyes were opened.
I will point to him, but not now; I bless him, but he draws not near: a star shall rise out of Jacob, a man shall spring out of Israel; and shall crush the princes of Moab, and shall spoil all the sons of Seth.
And Edom shall be an inheritance, and Esau his enemy shall be an inheritance of Israel, and Israel wrought valiantly.
And one shall arise out of Jacob, and destroy out of the city him that escapes.
And having seen Amalec, he took up his parable and said, Amalec is the first of the nations; yet his seed shall perish.
And having seen the Kenite, he took up his parable and said, thy dwelling-place is strong; yet though thou shouldest put thy nest in a rock,
and though Beor should have a skillfully contrived hiding-place, the Assyrians shall carry thee away captive.
And he looked upon Og, and took up his parable and said, Oh, oh, who shall live, when God shall do these things?
And one shall come forth from the hands of the Citians, and shall afflict Assur, and shall afflict the Hebrews, and they shall perish together.
And Balaam rose up and departed and returned to his place, and Balac went to his own home.
Pestilent flies will corrupt a preparation of sweet ointment: and a little wisdom is more precious than great glory of folly.
A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at his left.
Yea, and whenever a fool walks by the way, his heart will fail him, and all that he thinks of is folly.
If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place; for soothing will put an end to great offences.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, wherein an error has proceeded from the ruler.
The fool has been set in very high places, while rich men would sit in a low one.
I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants on the earth.
He that digs a pit shall fall into it; and him that breaks down a hedge a serpent shall bite.
He that removes stones shall be troubled thereby; he that cleaves wood shall be endangered thereby.
If the axe-head should fall off, then the man troubles his countenance, and he must put forth more strength: and in that case skill is of no advantage to a man.
If a serpent bite when there is no charmer's whisper, then there is no advantage to the charmer.
The words of a wise mouth are gracious: but the lips of a fool will swallow him up.
The beginning of the words of his mouth is folly: and the end of his talk mischievous madness.
A fool moreover multiplies words: man knows not what has been, nor what will be: who shall tell him what will come after him?
The labour of fools will afflict them, as that of one who knows not to go to the city.
Woe to thee, O city, whose king is young, and thy princes eat in the morning!
Blessed art thou, O land, whose king is a son of nobles, and whose princes shall eat seasonably, for strength, and shall not be ashamed.
By slothful neglect a building will be brought low: and by idleness of the hands the house will fall to pieces.
Men prepare bread for laughter, and wine and oil that the living should rejoice: but to money all things will humbly yield obedience.
Even in thy conscience, curse not the king; and curse not the rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry thy voice, and that which has wings shall report thy speech.
Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind is your mother's bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which debtor have I sold you? Behold, ye are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away.
Why did I come, and there was no man? why did I call, and there was none to hearken? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst.
I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth.
The Lord even God gives me the tongue of instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me early, he has given me an ear to hear:
and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute.
I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting:
but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed,
for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yea, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw nigh to me.
Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you.
Who is among you that fears the Lord? let him hearken to the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God.
Behold, ye all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which ye have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; ye shall lie down in sorrow.
O Lord, the king shall rejoice in thy strength; and in thy salvation he shall greatly exult.
Thou hast granted him the desire of his soul, and hast not withheld from him the request of his lips. Pause.
For thou hast prevented him with blessings of goodness: thou has set upon his head a crown of precious stone.
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest him length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great in thy salvation: thou wilt crown him with glory and majesty.
For thou wilt give him a blessing for ever and ever: thou wilt gladden him with joy with thy countenance.
For the king trusts in the Lord, and through the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved.
Let thy hand be found by all thine enemies: let thy right hand find all that hate thee.
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven at the time of thy presence: the Lord shall trouble them in his anger, and fire shall devour them.
Thou shalt destroy their fruit from the earth, and their seed from among the sons of men.
For they intended evils against thee; they imagined a device which they shall by no means be able to perform.
For thou shalt make them turn their back in thy latter end, thou wilt prepare their face.
Be thou exalted, O Lord, in thy strength: we will sing and praise thy mighty acts.
And the Lord said to Moses, Now thou shalt see what I will do to Pharao; for he shall send them forth with a mighty hand, and with a high arm shall he cast them out of his land.
And God spoke to Moses and said to him, I am the Lord.
And I appeared to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, being their God, but I did not manifest to them my name Lord.
And I established my covenant with them, to give them the land of the Chananites, the land wherein they sojourned, in which also they dwelt as strangers.
And I hearkened to the groaning of the children of Israel (the affliction with which the Egyptians enslave them) and I remembered the covenant with you.
Go, speak to the children of Israel, saying, I am the Lord; and I will lead you forth from the tyranny of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from bondage, and I will ransom you with a high arm, and great judgment.
And I will take you to me a people for myself, and will be your God; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from the tyranny of the Egyptians.
And I will bring you into the land concerning which I stretched out my hand to give it to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, and I will give it you for an inheritance: I am the Lord.
And Moses spoke thus to the sons of Israel, and they hearkened not to Moses for faint-heartedness, and for their hard tasks.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Go in, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, that he send forth the children of Israel out of his land.
And Moses spoke before the Lord, saying, Behold, the children of Israel hearkened not to me, and how shall Pharao hearken to me? and I am not eloquent.
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a charge to Pharao king of Egypt, that he should send forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
And these are the heads of the houses of their families: the sons of Ruben the first-born of Israel; Enoch and Phallus, Asron, and Charmi, this is the kindred of Ruben.
And the sons of Symeon, Jemuel and Jamin, and Aod, and Jachin and Saar, and Saul the son of a Phoenician woman, these are the families of the sons of Symeon.
And these are the names of the sons of Levi according to their kindreds, Gedson, Caath, and Merari; and the years of the life of Levi were a hundred and thirty-seven.
And these are the sons of Gedson, Lobeni and Semei, the houses of their family. And the sons of Caath,
Ambram and Issaar, Chebron, and Oziel; and the years of the life of Caath were a hundred and thirty-three years.
And the sons of Merari, Mooli, and Omusi, these are the houses of the families of Levi, according to their kindreds.
And Ambram took to wife Jochabed the daughter of his father's brother, and she bore to him both Aaron and Moses, and Mariam their sister: and the years of the life of Ambram were a hundred and thirty-two years.
And the sons of Issaar, Core, and Naphec, and Zechri.
And the sons of Oziel, Misael, and Elisaphan, and Segri.

And the sons of Core, Asir, and Elkana, and Abiasar, these are the generations of Core.
And Eleazar the son of Aaron took to himself for a wife one of the daughters of Phutiel, and she bore to him Phinees. These are the heads of the family of the Levites, according to their generations.
This is Aaron and Moses, whom God told to bring out the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt with their forces.
These are they that spoke with Pharao king of Egypt, and Aaron himself and Moses brought out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt,
in the day in which the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt;
then the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, I am the Lord: speak to Pharao king of Egypt whatsoever I say to thee.
And Moses said before the Lord, Behold, I am not able in speech, and how shall Pharao hearken to me?
And Job further continued and said in his parable,
As God lives, who has thus judge me; and the Almighty, who has embittered my soul;
verily, while my breath is yet in me, and the breath of God which remains to me is in my nostrils,
my lips shall not speak evil words, neither shall my soul meditate unrighteous thoughts.
Far be it from me that I should justify you till I die; for I will not let go my innocence,
but keeping fast to my righteousness I will by no means let it go: for I am not conscious to myself of having done any thing amiss.
Nay rather, but let mine enemies be as the overthrow of the ungodly, and they that rise up against me, as the destruction of transgressors.
For what is the hope of the ungodly, that he holds to it? will he indeed trust in the Lord and be saved?
Will God hear his prayer? or, when distress has come upon him,
has he any confidence before him? or will God hear him as he calls upon him?
Yet now I will tell you what is in the hand of the Lord: I will not lie concerning the things which are with the Almighty.
Behold, ye all know that ye are adding vanity to vanity.
This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of oppressors shall come upon them from the Almighty.
And if their children be many, they shall be for slaughter: and if they grow up, they shall beg.
And they that survive of him shall utterly perish, and no one shall pity their widows.
Even if he should gather silver as earth, and prepare gold as clay;
All these things shall the righteous gain, and the truehearted shall possess his wealth.
And his house is gone like moths, and like a spider's web.
The rich man shall lie down, and shall not continue: he has opened his eyes, and he is not.
Pains have come upon him as water, and darkness has carried him away by night.
And Samuel died, and all Israel assembled, and bewailed him, and they bury him in his house in Armathaim: and David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Maon.
And there was a man in Maon, and his flocks were in Carmel, and he was a very great man; and he had three thousand sheep, and a thousand she-goats: and he happened to be shearing his flock in Carmel.
And the man's name was Nabal, and his wife's name was Abigaia: and his wife was of good understanding and very beautiful in person: but the man was harsh, and evil in his doings, and the man was churlish.
And David heard in the wilderness, that Nabal the Carmelite was shearing his sheep.
And David sent ten young men, and he said to the young men, Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and ask him in my name how he is.
And thus shall ye say, May thou and thy house seasonably prosper, and all thine be in prosperity.
And now, behold, I have heard that thy shepherds who were with is in the wilderness are shearing thy sheep, and we hindered them not, neither did we demand any thing from them all the time they were in Carmel.
Ask thy servants, and they will tell thee. Let then thy servants find grace in thine eyes, for we are come on a good day; give we pray thee, whatsoever thy hand may find, to thy son David.
So the servants come and speak these words to Nabal, according to all these words in the name of David.
And Nabal sprang up, and answered the servants of David, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jessae? Now-a-days there is abundance of servants who depart every one from his master.
And shall I take my bread, and my wine, and my beasts that I have slain for my shearers, and shall I give them to men of whom I know not whence they are?
So the servants of David turned back, and returned, and came and reported to David according to these words.
And David said to his men, Gird on every man his sword. And they went up after David, about four hundred men: and two hundred abode with the stuff.
And one of the servants reported to Abigaia the wife of Nabal, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our lord; but he turned away from them.
And the men were very good to us; they did not hinder us, neither did they demand from us any thing all the days that we were with them.
And when we were in the field, they were as a wall round about us, both by night and by day, all the days that we were with them feeding the flock.
And now do thou consider, and see what thou wilt do; for mischief is determined against our lord and against his house; and he is a vile character, and one cannot speak to him.
And Abigaia hasted, and took two hundred loaves, and two vessels of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five ephahs of fine flour, and one homer of dried grapes, and two hundred cakes of figs, and put them upon asses.
And she said to her servants, Go on before me, and behold I come after you: but she told not her husband.
And it came to pass when she had mounted her ass and was going down by the covert of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down to meet her, and she met them.
And David said, Perhaps I have kept all his possessions in the wilderness that he should wrong me, and we did not order the taking anything of all his goods; yet he has rewarded me evil for good.
So God do to David and more also, if I leave one male of all that belong to Nabal until the morning.
And Abigaia saw David, and she hasted and alighted from her ass; and she felt before David on her face, and did obeisance to him, bowing to the ground
even to his feet, and said, On me, my lord, be my wrong: let, I pray thee, thy servant speak in thine ears, and hear thou the words of thy servant.
Let not my lord, I pray thee, take to heart this pestilent man, for according to his name, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him: but I thy handmaid saw not the servants of my lord whom thou didst send.
And now, my lord, as the Lord lives, and thy soul lives, as the Lord has kept thee from coming against innocent blood, and from executing vengeance for thyself, now therefore let thine enemies, and those that seek evil against my lord, become as Nabal.
And now accept this token of goodwill, which thy servant has brought to my lord, and thou shalt give it to the servants that wait on my lord.
Remove, I pray thee, the trespass of thy servant; for the Lord will surely make for my lord a sure house, for the Lord fights the battles of my lord, and there shall no evil be ever found in thee.
And if a man shall rise up persecuting thee and seeking thy life, yet shall the life of my lord be bound up in the bundle of life with the Lord God, and thou shalt whirl the life of thine enemies as in the midst of a sling.
And it shall be when the Lord shall have wrought for my lord all the good things he has spoken concerning thee, and shall appoint thee to be ruler over Israel;
then this shall not be an abomination and offence to my lord, to have shed innocent blood without cause, and for my lord to have avenged himself: and so may the Lord do good to my lord, and thou shalt remember thine handmaid to do her good.
And David said to Abigaia, Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent thee this very day to meet me:
and blessed be thy conduct, and blessed be thou, who hast hindered me this very day from coming to shed blood, and from avenging myself.
But surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, who hindered me this day from doing thee harm, if thou hadst not hasted and come to meet me, then I said, There shall surely not be left to Nabal till the morning one male.
And David took of her hand all that she brought to him, and said to her, Go in peace to thy house: see, I have hearkened to thy voice, and accepted thy petition.
And Abigaia came to Nabal: and, behold, he had a banquet in this house, as the banquet of a king, and the heart of Nabal was merry within him, and he was very drunken: and she told him nothing great or small till the morning light.
And it came to pass in the morning, when Nabal recovered from his wine, his wife told him these words; and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.
And it came to pass after about ten days, that the Lord smote Nabal, and he died.
And David heard it and said, Blessed be the Lord, who has judged the cause of my reproach at the hand of Nabal, and has delivered his servant from the power of evil; and the Lord has returned the mischief of Nabal upon his own head. And David sent and spoke concerning Abigaia, to take her to himself for a wife.
So the servants of David came to Abigaia to Carmel, and spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to thee, to take thee to himself for a wife.
And she arose, and did reverence with her face to the earth, and said, Behold, thy servant is for an handmaid to wash the feet of thy servants.
And Abigaia arose, and mounted her ass, and five damsels followed her: and she went after the servants of David, and became his wife.
And David took Achinaam out of Jezrael, and they were both his wives.
And Saul gave Melchol his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Amis who was of Romma.
There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is abundant with man:
a man to whom God shall give wealth, and substance, and honour, and he wants nothing for his soul of all things that he shall desire, yet God shall not give him power to eat of it, for a stranger shall devour it: this is vanity, and an evil infirmity.
If a man beget a hundred children, and live many years, yea, however abundant the days of his years shall be, yet if his soul shall not be satisfied with good, and also he have no burial; I said, An untimely birth is better than he.
For he came in vanity, and departs in darkness, and his name shall be covered in darkness.
Moreover he has not seen the sun, nor known rest: there is no more rest to this one than another.
Though he has lived to the return of a thousand years, yet he has seen no good: do not all go to one place?
All the labour of a man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite shall not be satisfied.
For what advantage has the wise man over the fool, since even the poor knows how to walk in the direction of life?
The sight of the eyes is better than that which wanders in soul: this is also vanity, and waywardness of spirit.
If anything has been, its name has already been called: and it is known what man is; neither can he contend with him who is stronger than he.
For there are many things which increase vanity.
Surely these men who came up out of Egypt from twenty years old and upward, who know good and evil, shall not see the land which I sware to give to Abraam and Isaac and Jacob, for they have not closely followed after me:
save Caleb the son of Jephonne, who was set apart, and Joshua the son of Naue, for they closely followed after the Lord.
And the Lord was very angry with Israel; and for forty years he caused them to wander in the wilderness, until all the generation which did evil in the sight of the Lord was extinct.
Behold, ye are risen up in the room of your fathers, a combination of sinful men, to increase yet farther the fierce wrath of the Lord against Israel.
For ye will turn away from him to desert him yet once more in the wilderness, and ye will sin against this whole congregation.
And they came to him, and said, We will build here folds for our cattle, and cities for our possessions;
and we will arm ourselves and go as an advanced guard before the children of Israel, until we shall have brought them into their place; and our possessions shall remain in walled cities because of the inhabitants of the land.
We will not return to our houses till the children of Israel shall have been distributed, each to his own inheritance.
And we will not any longer inherit with them from the other side of Jordan and onwards, because we have our full inheritance on the side beyond Jordan eastward.
And Moses said to them, If ye will do according to these words, if ye will arm yourselves before the Lord for battle,
and every one of you will pass over Jordan fully armed before the Lord, until his enemy be destroyed from before his face,
and the land shall be subdued before the Lord, then afterwards ye shall return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and as regards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before the Lord.
But if ye will not do so, ye will sin against the Lord; and ye shall know your sin, when afflictions shall come upon you.
And ye shall build for yourselves cities for your store, and folds for your cattle; and ye shall do that which proceeds out of your mouth.
And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as our lord commands.
Our store, and our wives, and all our cattle shall be in the cities of Galaad.
But thy servants will go over all armed and set in order before the Lord to battle, as our lord says.
And Moses appointed to them for judges Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Naue, and the chiefs of the families of the tribes of Israel.
And Moses said to them, If the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad will pass over Jordan with you, every one armed for war before the Lord, and ye shall subdue the land before you, then ye shall give to them the land of Galaad for a possession.
But if they will not pass over armed with you to war before the Lord, then shall ye cause to pass over their possessions and their wives and their cattle before you into the land of Chanaan, and they shall inherit with you in the land of Chanaan.
And the sons of Ruben and the sons of Gad answered, saying, Whatsoever the Lord says to his servants, that will we do.
We will go over armed before the Lord into the land of Chanaan, and ye shall give us our inheritance beyond Jordan.
And Moses gave to them, even to the sons of Gad and the sons of Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasse of the sons of Joseph, the kingdom of Seon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Basan, the land and its cities with its coasts, the cities of the land round about.
And the sons of Gad built Daebon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,
and Sophar, and Jazer, and they set them up,
and Namram, and Baetharan, strong cities, and folds for sheep.
And the sons of Ruben built Esebon, and Eleale, and Kariatham,
and Beelmeon, surrounded with walls, and Sebama; and they called the names of the cities which they built, after their own names.
And a son of Machir the son of Manasse went to Galaad, and took it, and destroyed the Amorite who dwelt in it.
And Moses gave Galaad to Machir the son of Manasse, and he dwelt there.
And Jair the son of Manasse went and took their villages, and called them the villages of Jair.
And Nabau went and took Caath and her villages, and called them Naboth after his name.
The Lord reigns; let the people rage; it is he that sits upon the cherubs, let the earth be moved.
The Lord is great in Sion, and is high over all the people.
Let them give thanks to thy great name; for it is terrible and holy.
And the king's honour loves judgment; thou hast prepared equity, thou hast wrought judgment and justice in Jacob.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool; for he is holy.
Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that call upon his name; they called upon the Lord, and he heard them.
He spoke to them in a pillar of cloud; they kept his testimonies, and the ordinances which he gave them.
O Lord our God, thou heardest them; O God, thou becamest propitious to them, though thou didst take vengeance on all their devices.
Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his holy mountain; for the Lord our God is holy.
See now! what is so good, or what so pleasant, as for brethren to dwell together?
It is as ointment on the head, that ran down to the beard, even the beard of Aaron; that ran down to the fringe of his clothing.
As the dew of Aermon, that comes down on the mountains of Sion: for there, the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for ever.
And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joatham, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, there came up Rasim king of Aram, and Phakee son of Romelias, king of Israel, against Jerusalem to war against it, but they could not take it.
And a message was brought to the house of David, saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind.
And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, thou, and thy son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller's field.
And thou shalt say to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let thy soul be disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce anger is over, I will heal again.
And as for the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have devised an evil counsel, saying,
We will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it;
thus saith the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall not abide, nor come to pass.
But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from being a people.
And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but if ye believe not, neither will ye at all understand.
And the Lord again spoke to Achaz, saying,
Ask for thyself a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height.
And Achaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord.
And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a little thing for you to contend with men? and how do ye contend against the Lord?
Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel.
Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows either to prefer evil or choose the good.
For before the child shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good; and the land shall be forsaken which thou art afraid of because of the two kings.
But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days which have never come, from the day that Ephraim took away from Juda the king of the Assyrians.
And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the flies, which insect shall rule over a part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of the Assyrians.
And they all shall enter into the clefts of the land, and into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves, and into every ravine.
In that day the Lord shall shave with the hired razor of the king of Assyria beyond the river the head, and the hairs of the feet, and will remove the beard.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall rear a heifer, and two sheep.
And it shall come to pass from their drinking an abundance of milk, that every one that is left on the land shall eat butter and honey.
And it shall come to pass in that day, for every place where there shall be a thousand vines at a thousand shekels, they shall become barren land and thorns.
Men shall enter thither with arrow and bow; for all the land shall be barren ground and thorns.
And every mountain shall be certainly ploughed: there shall no fear come thither: for there shall be from among the barren ground and thorns that whereon cattle shall feed and oxen shall tread.
Give heed, O my people, to my law: incline your ear to the words of my mouth.
I will open my mouth in parables: I will utter dark sayings which have been from the beginning.
All which we have heard and known, and our fathers have declared to us.
They were not hid from their children to a second generations; the fathers declaring the praises of the Lord, and his mighty acts, and his wonders which he wrought.
And he raised up a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, to make it known to their children:
that another generation might know, even the sons which should be born; and they should arise and declare them to their children.
That they might set their hope on God, and not forget the works of God, but diligently seek his commandments.
That they should not be as their fathers, a perverse and provoking generation; a generation which set not its heart aright, and its spirit was not steadfast with God.
The children of Ephraim, bending and shooting with the bow, turned back in the day of battle.
They kept not the covenant of God, and would not walk in his law.
And they forgot his benefits, and his miracles which he had shewed them;
the miracles which he wrought before their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the plain of Tanes.
He clave the sea, and led them through: he made the waters to stand as in a bottle.
And he guided them with a cloud by day, and all the night with a light of fire.
he clave a rock in the wilderness, and made them drink as in a great deep.
And he brought water out of the rock, and caused waters to flow down as rivers.
And they sinned yet more against him; they provoked the Most High in the wilderness.
And they tempted God in their hearts, in asking meat for the desire of their souls.
They spoke also against God, and said, Will God be able to prepare a table in the wilderness?
Forasmuch as he smote the rock, and the waters flowed, and the torrents ran abundantly; will he be able also to give bread, or prepare a table for his people?
Therefore the Lord heard, and was provoked: and fire was kindled in Jacob, and wrath went up against Israel.
Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation.
Yet he commanded the clouds from above, and opened the doors of heaven,
and rained upon them manna to eat, and gave them the bread of heaven.
Man ate angels' bread; he sent them provision to the full.
He removed the south wind from heaven; and by his might he brought in the south-west wind.
And he rained upon them flesh like dust, and feathered birds like the sand of the seas.
And they fell into the midst of their camp, round about their tents.
So they ate, and were completely filled; and he gave them their desire.
They were not disappointed of their desire: but when their food was yet in their mouth,
then the indignation of God rose up against them, and slew the fattest of them, and overthrew the choice men of Israel.
In the midst of all this they sinned yet more, and believed not his miracles.
And their days were consumed in vanity, and their years with anxiety.
When he slew them, they sought him: and they returned and called betimes upon God.
And they remembered that God was their helper, and the most high God was their redeemer.
Yet they loved him only with their mouth, and lied to him with their tongue.
For their heart was not right with him, neither were they steadfast in his covenant.
But he is compassionate, and will forgive their sins, and will not destroy them: yea, he will frequently turn away his wrath, and will not kindle all his anger.
And he remembered that they are flesh; a wind that passes away, and returns not.
How often did they provoke him in the wilderness, and anger him in a dry land!
Yea, they turned back, and tempted God, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
They remembered not his hand, the day in which he delivered them from the hand of the oppressor.
How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Tanes:
and had changed their rivers into blood; and their streams, that they should not drink.
He sent against them the dog-fly, and it devoured them; and the frog, and it spoiled them.
And he gave their fruit to the canker worm, and their labours to the locust.
He killed their vines with hail, and their sycamores with frost.
And he gave up their cattle to hail, and their substance to the fire.
He sent out against them the fury of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and affliction, a message by evil angels.
He made a way for his wrath; he spared not their souls from death, but consigned their cattle to death;
and smote every first-born in the land of Egypt; the first-fruits of their labours in the tents of Cham.
And he removed his people like sheep; he led them as a flock in the wilderness.
And he guided them with hope, and they feared not: but the sea covered their enemies.
And he brought them in to the mountain of his sanctuary, this mountain which his right hand had purchased.
And he cast out the nations from before them, and made them to inherit by a line of inheritance, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies.
And they turned back, and broke covenant, even as also their fathers: they became like a crooked bow.
And they provoked him with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.
God heard and lightly regarded them, and greatly despised Israel.
And he rejected the tabernacle of Selom, his tent where he dwelt among men.
And he gave their strength into captivity, and their beauty into the enemy's hand.
And he gave his people to the sword; and disdained his inheritance.
Fire devoured their young men; and their virgins mourned not.
Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows shall not be wept for.
So the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and as a mighty man who has been heated with wine.
And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he brought on them a perpetual reproach.
And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim;
but chose the tribe of Juda, the mount Sion which he loved.
And he built his sanctuary as the place of unicorns; he founded it for ever on the earth.
He chose David also his servant, and took him up from the flocks of sheep.
He took him from following the ewes great with young, to be the shepherd of Jacob his servant, and Israel his inheritance.
So he tended them in the innocency of his heart; and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
And it came to pass after this that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Annon his son reigned in his stead.
And David said, I will shew mercy to Annon the son of Naas, as his father dealt mercifully with me. And David sent to comfort him concerning his father by the hand of his servants; and the servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon.
And the princes of the children of Ammon said to Annon their lord, Is it to honour thy father before thee that David has sent comforters to thee? Has not David rather sent his servants to thee that they should search the city, and spy it out and examine it?
And Annon took the servants of David, and shaved their beards, and cut off their garments in the midst as far as their haunches, and sent them away.
And they brought David word concerning the men; and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly dishonoured: and the king said, Remain in Jericho till your beards have grown, and then ye shall return.
And the children of Ammon saw that the people of David were ashamed; and the children of Ammon sent, and hired the Syrians of Baethraam, and the Syrians of Suba, and Roob, twenty thousand footmen, and the king of Amalec with a thousand men, and Istob with twelve thousand men.
And David heard, and sent Joab and all his host, even the mighty men.
And the children of Ammon went forth, and set the battle in array by the door of the gate: those of Syria, Suba, and Roob, and Istob, and Amalec, being by themselves in the field.
And Joab saw that the front of the battle was against him from that which was opposed in front and from behind, and he chose out some of all the young men of Israel, and they set themselves in array against Syria.
And the rest of the people he gave into the hand of Abessa his brother, and they set the battle in array opposite to the children of Ammon.
And he said, If Syria be too strong for me, then shall ye help me: and if the children of Ammon be too strong for thee, then will we be ready to help thee.
Be thou courageous, and let us be strong for our people, and for the sake of the cities of our God, and the Lord shall do that which is good in his eyes.
And Joab and his people with him advanced to battle against Syria, and they fled from before him.
And the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled, and they fled from before Abessa, and entered into the city: and Joab returned from the children of Ammon, and came to Jerusalem.
And the Syrians saw that they were worsted before Israel, and they gathered themselves together.
And Adraazar sent and gathered the Syrians from the other side of the river Chalamak, and they came to Aelam; and Sobac the captain of the host of Adraazar was at their head.
And Syria fled from before Israel, and David destroyed of Syria seven hundred chariots, and forty thousand horsemen, and he smote Sobac the captain of his host, and he died there.
And all the kings the servants of Adraazar saw that they were put to the worse before Israel, and they went over to Israel, and served them: and Syria was afraid to help the children of Ammon any more.
And Sampson went down to Thamnatha, and saw a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Philistines.
And he went up and told his father and his mother, and said, I have seen a woman in Thamnatha of the daughters of the Phylistines; and now take her to me for a wife.
And his father and his mother said to him, Are there no daughters of thy brethren, and is there not a woman of all my people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised Philistines? And Sampson said to his father, Take her for me, for she is right in my eyes.
And his father and his mother knew not that it was of the Lord, that he sought to be revenged on the Philistines: and at that time the Philistines lorded it over Israel.
And Sampson and his father and his mother went down to Thamnatha, and he came to the vineyard of Thamnatha; and behold, a young lion roared in meeting him.
And the spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon him, and he crushed him as he would have crushed a kid of the goats, and there was nothing in his hands: and he told not his father and his mother what he had done.
And they went down and spoke to the woman, and she was pleasing in the eyes of Sampson.
And after some time he returned to take her, and he turned aside to see the carcase of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees, and honey were in the mouth of the lion.
And he took it into his hands, and went on eating, and he went to his father and his mother, and gave to them, and they did eat; but he told them not that he took the honey out of the mouth of the lion.
And his father went down to the woman, and Sampson made there a banquet for seven days, for so the young men are used to do.
And it came to pass when they saw him, that they took thirty guests, and they were with him.
And Sampson said to them, I propound you a riddle: if ye will indeed tell it me, and discover it within the seven days of the feast, I will you give thirty sheets and thirty changes of raiment.
And if ye cannot tell it me, ye shall give me thirty napkins and thirty changes of apparel: and they said to him, Propound thy riddle, and we will hear it.
And he said to them, Meat came forth of the eater, and sweetness out of the strong: and they could not tell the riddle for three days.
And it came to pass on the fourth day, that they said to the wife of Sampson, Deceive now thy husband, and let him tell thee the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with fire: did ye invite us to do us violence?
And Sampson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but hate me, and lovest me not; for the riddle which thou hast propounded to the children of my people thou hast not told me: and Sampson said to her, If I have not told it to my father and my mother, shall I tell it to thee?
And she wept before him the seven days, during which their banquet lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told her, because she troubled him; and she told it to the children of her people.
And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day, before sunrise, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than a lion? and Sampson said to them, If ye had not ploughed with my heifer, ye would not have known my riddle.
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him powerfully, and he went down to Ascalon, and destroyed of the inhabitants thirty men, and took their garments, and gave the changes of raiment to them that told the riddle; and Sampson was very angry, and went up to the house of his father.
And the wife of Sampson was given to one of his friends, with whom he was on terms of friendship.
And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel,
and Moses said to Aaron, Take to thyself a young calf of the herd for a sin-offering, and a ram for a whole-burnt-offering, unblemished, and offer them before the Lord.
And speak to the elders of Israel, saying, Take one kid of the goats for a sin-offering, and a young calf, and a lamb of a year old for a whole-burnt-offering, spotless,
and a calf and a ram for a peace offering before the Lord, and fine flour mingled with oil, for to-day the Lord will appear among you.
And they took as Moses commanded them before the tabernacle of witness, and all the congregation drew nigh, and they stood before the Lord.
And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord has spoken; do it, and the glory of the Lord shall appear among you.
And Moses said to Aaron, Draw nigh to the altar, and offer thy sin-offering, and thy whole-burnt-offering, and make atonement for thyself, and for thy house; and offer the gifts of the people, and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Aaron drew nigh to the altar, and slew the calf of his sin-offering.
And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he dipped his finger into the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and he poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar.
And he offered up on the altar the fat and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver of the sin-offering, according as the Lord commanded Moses.
And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire outside of the camp.
And he slew the whole-burnt-offering; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he poured it on the altar round about.
And they brought the whole-burnt-offering, according to its pieces; them and the head he put upon the altar.
And he washed the belly and the feet with water, and he put them on the whole-burnt-offering on the altar.
And he brought the gift of the people, and took the goat of the sin-offering of the people, and slew it, and purified it as also the first.
And he brought the whole-burnt-offering, and offered it in due form.
And he brought the sacrifice and filled his hands with it, and laid it on the altar, besides the morning whole-burnt-offering.
And he slew the calf, and the ram of the sacrifice of peace-offering of the people; and the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he poured it out on the altar round about.
And he took the fat of the calf, and the hind quarters of the ram, and the fat covering the belly, and the two kidneys, and the fat upon them, and the caul on the liver.
And he put the fat on the breasts, and offered the fat on the altar.
And Aaron separated the breast and the right shoulder as a choice-offering before the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Aaron lifted up his hands on the people and blessed them; and after he had offered the sin-offering, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the peace-offerings, he came down.
And Moses and Aaron entered into the tabernacle of witness. And they came out and blessed all the people, and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people.
And fire came forth from the Lord, and devoured the offerings on the altar, both the whole-burnt-offerings and the fat; and all the people saw, and were amazed, and fell upon their faces.
And Abraam was old, advanced in days, and the Lord blessed Abraam in all things.
And it shall be, the virgin to whomsoever I shall say, Incline thy water-pot, that I may drink, and she shall say, Drink thou, and I will give thy camels drink, until they shall have done drinkingeven this one thou hast prepared for thy servant Isaac, and hereby shall I know that thou hast dealt mercifully with my master Abraam.
And it came to pass before he had done speaking in his mind, that behold, Rebecca the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Melcha, the wife of Nachor, and  the brother of Abraam, came forth, having a water-pot on her shoulders.
And she said, I will also draw water for thy camels, till they shall all have drunk.
And she hasted, and emptied the water-pot into the trough, and ran to the well to draw again, and drew water for all the camels.
And the man took great notice of her, and remained silent to know whether the Lord had made his way prosperous or not.
And it came to pass when all the camels ceased drinking, that the man took golden ear-rings, each of a drachm weight, and he two bracelets on her hands, their weight was ten pieces of gold.
But thou shalt go to the house of my father, and to my tribe, and thou shalt take thence a wife for my son.
And I said to my master, Haply the woman will not go with me.
And he said to me, The Lord God to whom I have been acceptable in his presence, himself shall send out his angel with thee, and shall prosper thy journey, and thou shalt take a wife for my son of my tribe, and of the house of my father.
behold, I stand by the well of water, and the daughters of the men of the city come forth to draw water, and it shall be the damsel to whom I shall say, Give me a little water to drink out of thy pitcher,
and she shall say to me, Both drink thou, and I will draw water for thy camels, this the wife whom the Lord has prepared for his own servant Isaac; and hereby shall I know that thou hast wrought mercy with my master Abraam.
And they blessed Rebecca, and said to her, Thou art our sister; become thou thousands of myriads, and let thy seed possess the cities of their enemies.
And Rebecca rose up and her maidens, and they mounted the camels and went with the man; and the servant having taken up Rebecca, departed.
And Isaac went through the wilderness to the well of the vision, and he dwelt in the land toward the south.
And the servant told Isaac all that he had done.
And Isaac went into the house of his mother, and took Rebecca, and she became his wife, and he loved her; and Isaac was comforted for Sarrha his mother.
And it shall be equal below, they shall be equal toward the same part from the heads to one joining; so shalt thou make to both the two corners, let them be equal.
And there shall be eight posts, and their sixteen silver sockets; two sockets to one post on both its sides, and two sockets to the other post.
And thou shalt make bars of incorruptible wood; five to one post on one side of the tabernacle,
and five bars to one post on the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars to the hinder posts, on the side of the tabernacle toward the sea.
And let the bar in the middle between the posts go through from the one side to the other side.
And thou shalt gild the posts with gold; and thou shalt make golden rings, into which thou shalt introduce the bars, and thou shalt gild the bars with gold.
And thou shalt set up the tabernacle according to the pattern shewed thee in the mount.
And thou shalt make a veil of blue and purple and scarlet woven, and fine linen spun: thou shalt make it cherubs in woven work.
And thou shalt set it upon four posts of incorruptible wood overlaid with gold; and their tops shall be gold, and their four sockets shall be of silver.
And thou shalt put the veil on the posts, and thou shalt carry in thither within the veil the ark of the testimony; and the veil shall make a separation for you between the holy and the holy of holies.
And thou shalt screen with the veil the ark of the testimony in the holy of holies.
And thou shalt set the table outside the veil, and the candlestick opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle; and thou shalt put the table on the north side of the tabernacle.
And thou shalt make a screen for the door of the tabernacle of blue, and purple, and spun scarlet and fine linen spun, the work of the embroiderer.
Is not the life of man upon earth a state of trial? and his existence as that of a hireling by the day?
Or as a servant that fears his master, and one who has grasped a shadow? or as a hireling waiting for his pay?
So have I also endured months of vanity, and nights of pain have been appointed me.
Whenever I lie down, I say, When will it be day? and whenever I rise up, again I say when will it be evening? and I am full of pains from evening to morning.
And my body is covered with loathsome worms; and I waste away, scraping off clods of dust from my eruption.
And my life is lighter than a word, and has perished in vain hope.
Remember then that my life is breath, and mine eye shalt not yet again see good.
I am as a cloud that is cleared away from the sky: for if a man go down to the grave, he shall not come up again:
and he shall surely not return to his own house, neither shall his place know him any more.
Then neither will I refrain my mouth: I will speak being in distress; being in anguish I will disclose the bitterness of my soul.
Am I a sea, or a serpent, that thou hast set a watch over me?
I said that my bed should comfort me, and I would privately counsel with myself on my couch.
Thou scarest me with dreams, and dost terrify me with visions.
Thou wilt separate life from my spirit; and yet keep my bones from death.
For I shall not live for ever, that I should patiently endure: depart from me, for my life is vain.
For what is man, that thou hast magnified him? or that thou givest heed to him?
Wilt thou visit him till the morning, and judge him till the time of rest?
How long dost thou not let me alone, nor let me go, until I shall swallow down my spittle?
If I have sinned, what shall I be able to do, O thou that understandest the mind of men? why hast thou made me as thine accuser, and why am I a burden to thee?
Why hast thou not forgotten my iniquity, and purged my sin? but now I shall depart to the earth; and in the morning I am no more.
And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from Abenezer to Azotus.
And the Philistines took the ark of the Lord, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.
And the people of Azotus rose early, and entered into the house of Dagon; and looked, and behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the Lord: and they lifted up Dagon, and set him in his place. And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon the Azotians, and he plagued them, and he smote them in their secret parts, Azotus and her coasts.
And it came to pass when they rose early in the morning, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face before the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands were cut off each before the threshold, and both the wrists of his hands had fallen on the floor of the porch; only the stump of Dagon was left.
Therefore the priests of Dagon, and every one that enters into the house of Dagon, do not tread upon the threshold of the house of Dagon in Azotus until this day, for they step over.
And the hand of the Lord was heavy upon Azotus, and he brought evil upon them, and it burst out upon them into the ships, and mice sprang up in the midst of their country, and there was a great and indiscriminate mortality in the city.
And the men of Azotus saw that it was so, and they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god.
And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines to them, and say, What shall we do to the ark of the God of Israel? and the Gittites say, Let the ark of God come over to us; and the ark of the God of Israel came to Geth.
And it came to pass after it went about to Geth, that the hand of the Lord comes upon the city, a very great confusion; and he smote the men of the city small and great, and smote them in their secret parts: and the Gittites made to themselves images of emerods.
And they send away the ark of God to Ascalon; and it came to pass when the ark of God went into Ascalon, that the men of Ascalon cried out, saying, Why have ye brought back the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people?
And they send and gather the lords of the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it lodge in its place; and let it not slay us and our people.
For there was a very great confusion in all the city, when the ark of the God of Israel entered there; and those, who lived and died not were smitten with emerods; and the cry of the city went up to heaven.
My soul, praise the Lord.
While I live will I praise the Lord: I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist.
Trust not in princes, nor in the children of men, in whom there is no safety.
His breath shall go forth, and he shall return to his earth; in that day all his thoughts shall perish.
Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God:
who made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all things in them: who keeps truth for ever:
who executes judgment for the wronged: who gives food to the hungry. The Lord looses the fettered ones:
the Lord gives wisdom to the blind: The Lord sets up the broken down: the Lord loves the righteous: the Lord preserves the strangers;
he will relieve the orphan and widow: but will utterly remove the way of sinners.
The Lord shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Sion, to all generations.
And Joshua was old and very advanced in years; and the Lord said to Joshua, Thou art advanced in years, and there is much land left to inherit.
And this is the land that is left: the borders of the Phylistines, the Gesirite, and the Chananite,
from the wilderness before Egypt, as far as the borders of Accaron on the left of the Chananites the land is reckoned to the five principalities of the Phylistines, to the inhabitant of Gaza, and of Azotus, and of Ascalon, and of Geth, and of Accaron, and to the Evite;
from Thaeman even to all the land of Chanaan before Gaza, and the Sidonians as far as Aphec, as far as the borders of the Amorites.
And all the land of Galiath of the Phylistines, and all Libanus eastward from Galgal, under the mountain Aermon as far as the entering in of Emath;
every one that inhabits the hill country from Libanus as far as Masereth Memphomaim. All the Sidonians, I will destroy them from before Israel; but do thou give them by inheritance to Israel, as I charged thee.
And now divide this land by lot to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe of Manasse.
From Jordan to the great sea westward thou shalt give it them: the great sea shall be the boundary. But to the two tribes and to the half tribe of Manasse, to Ruben and to Gad Moses gave an inheritance beyond Jordan: Moses the servant of the Lord gave it to them eastward,
from Aroer, which is on the bank of the brook of Arnon, and the city in the midst of the valley, and all Misor from Maedaban.
All the cities of Seon king of the Amorites, who reigned from Esebon to the coasts of the children of Ammon;
and the region of Galaad, and the borders of the Gesirites and the Machatites, the whole mount of Aermon, and all the land of Basan to Acha.
All the kingdom of Og in the region of Basan, who reigned in Astaroth and in Edrain: he was left of the giants; and Moses smote him, and destroyed him.
But the children of Israel destroyed not the Gesirite and the Machatite and the Chananite; and the king of the Gesiri and the Machatite dwelt among the children of Israel until this day.
Only no inheritance was given to the tribe of Levi: the Lord God of Israel, he is their inheritance, as the Lord said to them; and this is the division which Moses made to the children of Israel in Araboth Moab, on the other side of Jordan, by Jericho.
And Moses gave the land to the tribe of Ruben according to their families.
And their borders were from Aroer, which is opposite the brook of Arnon, and theirs is the city that is in the valley of Arnon; and all Misor,
to Esebon, and all the cities in Misor, and Daebon, and Baemon-Baal, and the house of Meelboth;
and Basan, and Bakedmoth, and Maephaad,
and Kariathaim, and Sebama, and Serada, and Sion in mount Enab;
and Baethphogor, and Asedoth Phasga, and Baetthasinoth,
and all the cities of Misor, and all the kingdom of Seon king of the Amorites, whom Moses smote, even him and the princes of Madian, and Evi, and Roboc, and Sur, and Ur, and Robe prince of the spoils of Sion, and the inhabitants of Sion.
And Balaam the son of Baeor the prophet they slew in the battle.
And the borders of Ruben wereeven Jordan was the boundary; this is the inheritance of the children of Ruben according to their families, these were their cities and their villages.
And Moses gave inheritance to the sons of Gad according to their families.
And their borders were Jazer, all the cities of Galaad, and half the land of the children of Ammon to Araba, which is before Arad.
And from Esebon to Araboth by Massepha, and Botanim, and Maan to the borders of Daebon,
and Enadom, and Othargai, and Baenthanabra, and Soccotha, and Saphan, and the rest of the kingdom of Sean king of Esebon: and Jordan shall be the boundary as far as part of the sea of Chenereth beyond Jordan eastward.
This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according to their families and according to their cities: according to their families they will turn their backs before their enemies, because their cities and their villages were according to their families.
And Moses gave to half the tribe of Manasse according to their families.
And their borders were from Maan, and all the kingdom of Basan, and all the kingdom of Og king of Basan, and all the villages of Jair, which are in the region of Basan, sixty cities:
and the half of Galaad, and in Astaroth, and in Edrain, royal cities of Og in the land of Basan, Moses gave to the sons of Machir the sons of Manasse, even to the half-tribe sons of Machir the sons of Manasse, according to their families.
These are they whom Moses caused to inherit beyond Jordan in Araboth Moab, beyond Jordan by Jericho eastward.
If ye do indeed speak righteousness, then do ye judge rightly, ye sons of men.
For ye work iniquities in your hearts in the earth: your hands plot unrighteousness.
Sinners have gone astray from the womb: they go astray from the belly: they speak lies.
Their venom is like that of a serpent; as that of a deaf asp, and that stops her ears;
which will not hear the voice of charmers, nor heed the charm prepared skillfully by the wise.
God has crushed their teeth in their mouth: God has broken the cheek-teeth of the lions.
They shall utterly pass away like water running through: he shall bend his bow till they shall fail.
They shall be destroyed as melted wax: the fire has fallen and they have not seen the sun.
Before your thorns feel the white thorn, he shall swallow you up as living, as in his wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he sees the vengeance of the ungodly: he shall wash his hands in the blood of the sinner.
And a man shall say, Verily then there is a reward for the righteous: verily there is a God that judges them in the earth.
Praise the Lord, ye servants of his, praise, the name of the Lord.
Let the name of the Lord be blessed, from this present time and for ever.
From the rising of the sun to his setting, the name of the Lord is to be praised.
The Lord is high above all the nations; his glory is above the heavens.
Who is as the Lord our God? who dwells in the high places,
and yet looks upon the low things in heaven, and on the earth:
who lifts up the poor from the earth, and raises up the needy from the dunghill;
to set him with princes, even with the princes of his people:
who settles the barren woman in a house, as a mother rejoicing over children.
In that day God shall bring his holy and great and strong sword upon the dragon, even the serpent that flees, upon the dragon, the crooked serpent: he shall destroy the dragon.
In that day there shall be a fair vineyard, and a desire to commence a song concerning it.
I am a strong city, a city in a siege: in vain shall I water it; for it shall be taken by night, and by day the wall shall fall.
There is no woman that has not taken hold of it; who will set me to watch stubble in the field? because of this enemy I have set her aside; therefore on this account the Lord has done all that he appointed.
I am burnt up; they that dwell in her shall cry, Let us make peace with him, let us make peace,
they that are coming are the children of Jacob. Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be filled with his fruit.
Shall he himself be thus smitten, even as he smote? and as he slew, shall he be thus slain?
Fighting and reproaching he will dismiss them; didst thou not meditate with a harsh spirit, to slay them with a wrathful spirit?
Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off.
The flock that dwelt there shall be left, as a deserted flock; and the ground shall be for a long time for pasture, and there shall flocks lie down to rest.
And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of the grass being parched. Come hither, ye women that come from a sight; for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them shall have no pity upon them, and he that formed them shall have no mercy upon them.
And it shall come to pass in that day that God shall fence men off from the channel of the river as far as Rhinocorura; but do ye gather one by one the children of Israel.
And it shall come to pass in that day that they shall blow the great trumpet, and the lost ones in the land of the Assyrians shall come, and the lost ones in Egypt, and shall worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.
And it came to pass when the kings of the Amorites who were beyond Jordan heard, and the kings of Phoenicia by the sea, that the Lord God had dried up the river Jordan from before the children of Israel when they passed over, that their hearts failed, and they were terror-stricken, and there was no sense in them because of the children of Israel.
And about this time the Lord said to Joshua, Make thee stone knives of sharp stone, and sit down and circumcise the children of Israel the second time.
And Joshua made sharp knives of stone, and circumcised the children of Israel at the place called the Hill of Foreskins.
And this is the way in which Joshua purified the children of Israel; as many as were born in the way, and as many as were uncircumcised of them that came out of Egypt,
all these Joshua circumcised; for forty and two years Israel wondered in the wilderness of Mabdaris
Wherefore most of the fighting men that came out of the land of Egypt, were uncircumcised, who disobeyed the commands of God; concerning whom also he determined that they should not see the land, which the Lord sware to give to their fathers, even a land flowing with milk and honey.
And in their place he raised up their sons, whom Joshua circumcised, because they were uncircumcised, having been born by the way.
And when they had been circumcised they rested continuing there in the camp till they were healed.
And the Lord said to Joshua the son of Naue, On this day have I removed the reproach of Egypt from you: and he called the name of that place Galgala.
And the children of Israel kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, to the westward of Jericho on the opposite side of the Jordan in the plain.
And they ate of the grain of the earth unleavened and new corn.
In this day the manna failed, after they had eaten of the corn of the land, and the children of Israel no longer had manna: and they took the fruits of the land of the Phoenicians in that year.
And it came to pass when Joshua was in Jericho, that he looked up with his eyes and saw a man standing before him, and there was a drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua drew near and said to him, Art thou for us or on the side of our enemies?
And he said to him, I am now come, the chief captain of the host of the Lord.
And Joshua fell on his face upon the earth, and said to him, Lord, what commandest thou thy servant?
Now the word of the Lord came to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying,
Rise, and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the cry of its wickedness is come up to me.
But Jonas rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid his fare, and went up into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of the Lord.
And the Lord raised up a wind on the sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of being broken.
And the sailors were alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in the ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone down into the hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored.
And the shipmaster came to him, and said to him, Why snorest thou? arise, and call upon thy God, that God may save us, and we perish not.
And each man said to his neighbour, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake this mischief is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.
And they said to him, Tell us what is thine occupation, and whence comest thou, and of what country and what people art thou?
And he said to them, I am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea, and the dry land.
Then the men feared exceedingly, and said to him, What is this that thou hast done? for the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord, because he had told them.
And they said to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for the sea rose, and lifted its wave exceedingly.
And Jonas said to them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is upon you.
And the men tried hard to return to the land, and were not able: for the sea rose and grew more and more tempestuous against them.
And they cried to the Lord, and said, Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this man's life, and bring not righteous blood upon us: for thou, Lord, hast done as thou wouldest.
So they took Jonas, and cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.
And the men feared the Lord very greatly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows.
As the hart earnestly desires the fountains of water, so my soul earnestly longs for thee, O God.
My soul has thirsted for the living God: when shall I come and appear before God?
My tears have been bread to me day and night, while they daily said to me, Where is thy God?
I remembered these things, and poured out my soul in me, for I will go to the place of thy wondrous tabernacle, even to the house of God, with a voice of exultation and thanksgiving and of the sound of those who keep festival.
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the salvation of my countenance.
O my God, my soul has been troubled within me: therefore will I remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Ermonites, from the little hill.
Deep calls to deep at the voice of thy cataracts: all thy billows and thy waves have gone over me.
By day the Lord will command his mercy, and manifest it by night: with me is prayer to the God of my life.
I will say to God, Thou art my helper; why hast thou forgotten me? wherefore do I go sad of countenance, while the enemy oppresses me?
While my bones were breaking, they that afflicted me reproached me; while they said to me daily, Where is thy God?
Wherefore art thou very sad, O my soul? and wherefore dost thou trouble me? hope in God; for I will give thanks to him; he is the health of my countenance, and my God.
Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, who trust in horses and chariots, for they are many; and in horses, which are a great multitude; and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel, and have not sought the Lord.
Therefore he has wisely brought evils upon them, and his word shall not be frustrated; and he shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and against their vain hope,
even an Egyptian, a man, and not God; the flesh of horses, and there is no help in them: but the Lord shall bring his hand upon them, and the helpers shall fail, and all shall perish together.
For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lion's whelp over prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and the animals are awe-struck and tremble at the fierceness of his wrath: so the Lord of hosts shall descend to fight upon the mount Sion, even upon her mountains.
As birds flying, so shall the Lord of hosts defend; he shall defend Jerusalem, and he shall rescue, and save and deliver.
Turn, ye children of Israel, who devise a deep and sinful counsel.
For in that day men shall renounce their silver idols and their golden idols, which their hands made.
And the Assyrian shall fall: not the sword of a great man, nor the sword of a mean man shall devour him; neither shall he flee from the face of the sword: but the young men shall be overthrown:
for they shall be compassed with rocks as with a trench, and shall be worsted; and he that flees shall be taken. Thus saith the Lord, Blesses is he that has a seed in Sion, and household friends in Jerusalem.
Give thanks to the Lord, and call upon his name; declare his works among the heathen.
Sing to him, yea, sing praises to him: tell forth all his wonderful works.
Glory in his holy name: let the heart of them that seek the Lord rejoice.
Seek ye the Lord, and be strengthened; seek his face continually.
Remember his wonderful works that he has done; his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth;
ye seed of Abraam, his servants, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all the earth.
He has remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded for a thousand generation:
which he established as a covenant to Abraam, and he remembered his oath to Isaac.
And he established it to Jacob for an ordinance, and to Israel for an everlasting covenant;
saying To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the line of your inheritance:
when they were few in number, very few, and sojourners in it.
And they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people.
He suffered no man to wrong them; and he rebuked kings for their sakes:
saying, Touch not my anointed ones; and do my prophets no harm.
Moreover he called for a famine upon the land; he broke the whole support of bread.
He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a slave.
They hurt his feet with fetters; his soul passed into iron,
until the time that his cause came on; the word of the Lord tried him as fire.
The king sent and loosed him; even the prince of the people, and let him go free.
He made him Lord over his house, and ruler of all his substance;
to chastise his rulers at his pleasure, and to teach his elders wisdom.
Israel also came into Egypt, and Jacob sojourned in the land of Cham.
And he increased his people greatly, and made them stronger than their enemies.
And he turned their heart to hate his people, to deal craftily with his servants.
He sent fort Moses his servant, and Aaron whom he had chosen.
He established among them his signs, and his wonders in the land of Cham.
He sent forth darkness, and made it dark; yet they rebelled against his words.
He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
Their land produced frogs abundantly, in the chambers of their kings.
He spoke, and the dog-fly came, and lice in all their coasts.
He turned their rain into hail, and sent flaming fire in their land.
And he smote their vines and their fig trees; and broke every tree of their coast.
He spoke, and the locust came, and caterpillars innumerable,
and devoured all the grass in their land, and devoured the fruit of the ground.
He smote also every first-born of their land, the first-fruits of all their labour.
And he brought them out with silver and gold; and there was not a feeble one among their tribes.
Egypt rejoiced at their departing; for the fear of them fell upon them.
He spread out a cloud for a covering to them, and fire to give them light by night.
They asked, and the quail came, and he satisfied them with the bread of heaven.
He clave the rock, and the waters flowed, rivers ran in dry places.
For he remembered his holy word, which he promised to Abraam his servant.
And he brought out his people with exultation, and his chosen with joy;
and gave them the lands of the heathen; and they inherited the labours of the people;
that they might keep his ordinances, and diligently seek his law.
Deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I am afraid of him, lest haply he should come and smite me, and the mother upon the children.
But thou saidst, I will do thee good, and will make thy seed as the sand of the sea, which shall not be numbered for multitude.
And he slept there that night, and took of the gifts which he carried , and sent out to Esau his brother,
And he gave them to his servants drove apart; and he said to his servants, Go on before me, and put a space between drove and drove.
And he charged the first, saying, If Esau my brother meet thee, and he ask thee, saying, Whose art thou? and whither wouldest thou go, and whose are these possessions advancing before thee?
And Saul chooses for himself three thousand men of the men of Israel: and there were with Saul two thousand who were in Machmas, and in mount Baethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gabaa of Benjamin: and he sent the rest of the people every man to his tent.
And Jonathan smote Nasib the Philistine that dwelt in the hill; and the Philistines hear of it, and Saul sounds the trumpet through all the land, saying, The servants have despised us.
And all Israel heard say, Saul has smitten Nasib the Philistine; now Israel had been put to shame before the Philistines; and the children of Israel went up after Saul in Galgala.
And the Philistines gather together to war with Israel; and then come up against Israel thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand by the seashore for multitude: and they come up, and encamp in Machmas, opposite Baethoron southward.
And the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait so that they could not draw nigh, and the people hid themselves in caves, and sheepfolds, and rocks, and ditches, and pits.
And they that went over went over Jordan to the land of Gad and Galaad: and Saul was yet in Galgala, and all the people followed after him in amazement.
And he continued seven days for the appointed testimony, as Samuel told him, and Samuel came not to Galgala, and his people were dispersed from him.
And Saul said, Bring hither victims, that I may offer whole-burnt-offerings and peace-offerings: and he offered the whole-burnt-offering.
And it came to pass when he had finished offering the whole-burnt-offering, that Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet him, and to bless him.
And Samuel said, What hast thou done? and Saul said, Because I saw how the people were scattered from me, and thou was not present as thou purposedst according to the set time of the days, and the Philistines were gathered to Machmas.
Then I said, Now will the Philistines come down to me to Galgala, and I have not sought the face of the Lord: so I forced myself and offered the whole-burnt-offering.
And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly; for thou hast not kept my command, which the Lord commanded thee, as now the Lord would have confirmed thy kingdom over Israel for ever.
But now thy kingdom shall not stand to thee, and the Lord shall seek for himself a man after his own heart; and the Lord shall appoint him to be a ruler over his people, because thou hast not kept all that the Lord commanded thee.
And Samuel arose, and departed from Galgala, and the remnant of the people went after Saul to meet him after the men of war, when they had come out of Galgala to Gabaa of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were found with him, about six hundred men.
And Saul and Jonathan his son, and the people that were found with them, halted in Gabaa, of Benjamin; and they wept: and the Philistines had encamped in Machmas.
And men came forth to destroy out of the land of the Philistines in three companies; one company turning by the way of Gophera toward the land of Sogal,
and another company turning the way of Baethoron, and another company turning by the way of Gabae that turns aside to Gai of Sabim.
And there was not found a smith in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make themselves sword or spear.
And all Israel went down to the Land of the Philistines to forge every one his reaping-hook and his tool, and every one his axe and his sickle.
And it was near the time of vintage: and their tools were valued at three shekels for a plough-share, and there was the same rate for the axe and the sickle.
And it came to pass in the days of the war of Machmas, that there was not a sword or spear found in the hand of all the people, that were with Saul and Jonathan; but with Saul and Jonathan his son was there found.
And there went out some from the camp of the Philistines to the place beyond Machmas.
Then Sophar the Minaean answered and said,
He that speaks much, should also hear on the other side: or does the fluent speaker think himself to be righteous? blessed is the short lived offspring of woman.
Be not a speaker of many words; for is there none to answer thee?
For say not, I am pure in my works, and blameless before him.
But oh that the Lord would speak to thee, and open his lips to thee!
Then shall he declare to thee the power of wisdom; for it shall be double of that which is with thee: and then shalt thou know, that a just recompence of thy sins has come to thee from the Lord.
Wilt thou find out the traces of the Lord? or hast thou come to the end of that which the Almighty has made?
Heaven is high; and what wilt thou do? and there are deeper things than those in hell; what dost thou know?
Or longer than the measure of the earth, or the breadth of the sea.
And if he should overthrow all things, who will say to him, What hast thou done?
For he knows the works of transgressors; and when he sees wickedness, he will not overlook it.
But man vainly buoys himself up with words; and a mortal born of woman is like an ass in the desert.
For if thou hast made thine heart pure, and liftest up thine hands towards him;
if there is any iniquity in thy hands, put if far from thee, and let not unrighteousness lodge in thy habitation.
For thus shall thy countenance shine again, as pure water; and thou shalt divest thyself of uncleanness, and shalt not fear.
And thou shalt forget trouble, as a wave that has passed by; and thou shalt not be scared.
And thy prayer shall be as the morning star, and life shall arise to thee as from the noonday.
And thou shalt be confident, because thou hast hope; and peace shall dawn to thee from out of anxiety and care.
For thou shalt be at ease, and there shall be no one to fight against thee; and many shall charge, and make supplication to thee.
But safety shall fail them; for their hope is destruction, and the eyes of the ungodly shall waste away.
Hearken, O Lord of my righteousness, attend to my petition; give ear to my prayer not uttered with deceitful lips.
Let my judgment come forth from thy presence; let mine eyes behold righteousness.
Thou has proved mine heart; thou hast visited me by night; thou hast tried me as with fire, and unrighteousness has not been found in me: I am purposed that my mouth shall not speak amiss.
As for the works of men, by the words of thy lips I have guarded myself from hard ways.
Direct my steps in thy paths, that my steps slip not.
I have cried, for thou heardest me, O God: incline thine ear to me, and hearken to my words.
Shew the marvels of thy mercies, thou that savest them that hope in thee.
Keep me as the apple of the eye from those that resist thy right hand: thou shalt screen me by the covering of thy wings,
from the face of the ungodly that have afflicted me: mine enemies have compassed about my soul.
They have enclosed themselves with their own fat: their mouth has spoken pride.
They have now cast me out and compassed me round about: they have set their eyes so as to bow them down to the ground.
They laid wait for me as a lion ready for prey, and like a lion's whelp dwelling in secret places.
Arise, O Lord, prevent them, and cast them down: deliver my soul from the ungodly: draw thy sword,
because of the enemies of thine hand: O Lord, destroy them from the earth; scatter them in their life, though their belly has been filled with thy hidden treasures: they have been satisfied with uncleanness, and have left the remnant of their possessions to their babes.
But I shall appear in righteousness before thy face: I shall be satisfied when thy glory appears.
Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will ye build me? and of what kind is to be the place of my rest?
For all these things are mine, saith the Lord: and to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the man that trembles at my words?
But the transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he that offers fine flour, as one that offers swine's blood; he that gives frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer. Yet they have chosen their own ways, and their soul has delighted in their abominations.
I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not hearken to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
Hear the words of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; speak ye, our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear their joy; but they shall be ashamed.
A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to his adversaries.
Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped it and brought forth a male.
Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children?
But I have raised this expectation, yet thou hast not remembered me, saith the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? saith thy God.
Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all ye that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that now mourn over her:
that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory.
For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees.
As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.
For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire.
For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord.
They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine's flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord.
And I know their works and their imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.
And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles.
And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters drawn by mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord.
And I will take of them priests and Levites, saith the Lord.
For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue.
And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, that all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, saith the Lord.
And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.
He shall come into their midst as the land, as an eagle against the house of the Lord, because they have transgressed my covenant, and have sinned against my law.
They shall soon cry out to me, saying, O God, we know thee.
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
If any man should have in the skin of his flesh a bright clear spot, and there should be in the skin of his flesh a plague of leprosy, he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests.
And the priest shall view the spot in the skin of his flesh; and if the hair in the spot be changed to white, and the appearance of the spot be below the skin of the flesh, it is a plague of leprosy; and the priest shall look upon it, and pronounce him unclean.
But if the spot be clear and white in the skin of his flesh, yet the appearance of it be not deep below the skin, and its hair have not changed itself for white hair, but it is dark, then the priest shall separate him that has the spot seven days;
and the priest shall look on the spot the seventh day; and, behold, if the spot remains before him, if the spot has not spread in the skin, then the priest shall separate him the second time seven days.
And the priest shall look upon him the second time on the seventh day; and, behold, if the spot be dark, and the spot have not spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is a mere mark, and the man shall wash his garments and be clean.
But if the bright spot should have changed and spread in the skin, after the priest has seen him for the purpose of purifying him, then shall he appear the second time to the priest,
and the priest shall look upon him; and, behold, if the mark have spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a leprosy.
And if a man have a plague of leprosy, then he shall come to the priest;
and the priest shall look, and, behold, if it is a white spot in the skin, and it has changed the hair to white, and there be some of the sound part of the quick flesh in the sore
it is a leprosy waxing old in the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him unclean, and shall separate him, because he is unclean.
And if the leprosy should have come out very evidently in the skin, and the leprosy should cover all the skin of the patient from the head to the feet, wheresoever the priest shall look;
then the priest shall look, and, behold, the leprosy has covered all the skin of the flesh; and the priest shall pronounce him clean of the plague, because it has changed all to white, it is clean.
But on whatsoever day the quick flesh shall appear on him, he shall be pronounced unclean.
And the priest shall look upon the sound flesh, and the sound flesh shall prove him to be unclean; for it is unclean, it is a leprosy.
But if the sound flesh be restored and changed to white, then shall he come to the priest;
and the priest shall see him, and, behold, if the plague is turned white, then the priest shall pronounce the patient clean: he is clean.
And if the flesh should have become an ulcer in his skin, and should be healed,
and there should be in the place of the ulcer a white sore, or one looking white and bright, or fiery, and it shall be seen by the priest;
then the priest shall look, and, behold, if the appearance be beneath the skin, and its hair has changed to white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; because it is a leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.
But if the priest look, and behold there is no white hair on it, and it be not below the skin of the flesh, and it be dark-coloured; then the priest shall separate him seven days.
But if it manifestly spread over the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy; it has broken out in the ulcer.
But if the bright spot should remain in its place and not spread, it is the scar of the ulcer; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
And if the flesh be in his skin in a state of fiery inflammation, and there should be in his skin the part which is healed of the inflammation, bright, clear, and white, suffused with red or very white;
then the priest shall look upon him, and, behold, if the hair being white is changed to a bright colour, and its appearance is lower than the skin, it is a leprosy; it has broken out in the inflammation, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy.
But if the priest should look, and, behold, there is not in the bright spot any white hair, and it should not be lower than the skin, and it should be dark, then the priest shall separate him seven days.
And the priest shall look upon him on the seventh day; and if the spot be much spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy, it has broken out in the ulcer.
But if the bright spot remain stationary, and be not spread in the skin, but the sore should be dark, it is a scar of inflammation; and the priest shall pronounce him clean, for it is the mark of the inflammation.
And if a man or a woman have in them a plague of leprosy in the head or the beard;
then the priest shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the appearance of it be beneath the skin, and in it there be thin yellowish hair, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a scurf, it is a leprosy of the head or a leprosy of the beard.
And if the priest should see the plague of the scurf, and, behold, the appearance of it be not beneath the skin, and there is no yellowish hair in it, then the priest shall set apart him that has the plague of the scurf seven days.
And the priest shall look at the plague on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scurf be not spread, and there be no yellowish hair on it, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow under the skin;
then the skin shall be shaven, but the scurf shall not be shaven; and the priest shall set aside the person having the scurf the second time for seven days.
And the priest shall see the scurf on the seventh day; and, behold, if the scurf is not spread in the skin after the man's being shaved, and the appearance of the scurf is not hollow beneath the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean; and he shall wash his garments, and be clean.
But if the scurf be indeed spread in the skin after he has been purified,
then the priest shall look, and, behold, if the scurf be spread in the skin, the priest shall not examine concerning the yellow hair, for he is unclean.
But if the scurf remain before him in its place, and a dark hair should have arisen in it, the scurf is healed: he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
And if a man or woman should have in the skin of their flesh spots of a bright whiteness,
then the priest shall look; and, behold, there being bright spots of a bright whiteness in the skin of their flesh, it is a tetter; it burst forth in the skin of his flesh; he is clean.
Let not my soul come into their counsel, and let not mine inward parts contend in their conspiracy, for in their wrath they slew men, and in their passion they houghed a bull.
Cursed be their wrath, for it was willful, and their anger, for it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in Israel.
Juda, thy brethren have praised thee, and thy hands shall be on the back of thine enemies; thy father's sons shall do thee reverence.
Juda is a lion's whelp: from the tender plant, my son, thou art gone up, having couched thou liest as a lion, and as a whelp; who shall stir him up?
Binding his foal to the vine, and the foal of his ass to the branch , he shall wash his robe in wine, and his garment in the blood of the grape.
His eyes shall be more cheering than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk.
Zabulon shall dwell on the coast, and he by a haven of ships, and shall extend to Sidon.
Issachar has desired that which is good; resting between the inheritances.
in the double cave which is opposite Mambre, in the land of Chanaan, the cave which Abraam bought of Ephron the Chettite, for a possession of a sepulchre.
There they buried Abraam and Sarrha his wife; there they buried Isaac, and Rebecca his wife; there they buried Lea;
O God, who shall be compared to thee? be not silent, neither be still, O God.
For behold, thine enemies have made a noise; and they that hate thee have lifted up the head.
Against thy people they have craftily imagined a device, and have taken counsel against thy saints.
They have said, Come, and let us utterly destroy them out of the nation; and let the name of Israel be remembered no more at all.
For they have taken counsel together with one consent: they have made a confederacy against thee;
even the tents of the Idumeans, and the Ismaelites; Moab, and the Agarenes;
Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalec; the Philistines also, with them that dwell at Tyre.
Yea, Assur too is come with them: they have become a help to the children of Lot. Pause.
Do thou to them as to Madiam, and to Sisera; as to Jabin at the brook of Kison.
They were utterly destroyed at Aendor: they became as dung for the earth.
Make their princes as Oreb and Zeb, and Zebee and Salmana; even all their princes:
who said, let us take to ourselves the altar of God as an inheritance.
O my God, make them as a wheel; as stubble before the face of the wind.
As fire which shall burn up a wood, as the flame may consume the mountains;
so shalt thou persecute them with thy tempest, and trouble them in thine anger.
Fill their faces with dishonour; so shall they seek thy name, O Lord.
Let them be ashamed and troubled for evermore; yea, let them be confounded and destroyed.
And let them know that thy name is Lord; that thou alone art Most High over all the earth.
A Song of Degrees. Many a time have they warred against me from my youth, let Israel now say:
Many a time have they warred against me from my youth: and yet they prevailed not against me.
The sinners wrought upon my back: they prolonged their iniquity.
The righteous Lord has cut asunder the necks of sinners.
Let all that hate Sion be put to shame and turned back.
Let them be as the grass of the house-tops, which withers before it is plucked up.
Wherewith the reaper fills not his hand, nor he that makes up the sheaves, his bosom.
Neither do they that go by say, The blessing of the Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of the Lord.
And while he spoke with me, I fell upon my face to the earth: and he touched me, and set me on my feet.
And he said, Behold, I make thee know the things that shall come to pass at the end of the wrath: for the vision is yet for an appointed time.
The ram which thou sawest that had the horns is the king of the Medes and Persians.
The he-goat is the King of the Greeks: and the great horn which was between his eyes, he is the first king.
And as for the one that was broken, in whose place there stood up four horns, four kings shall arise out of his nation, but not in their own strength.
And at the latter time of their kingdom, when their sins are coming to the full, there shall arise a king bold in countenance, and understanding riddles.
And his power shall be great, and he shall destroy wonderfully, and prosper, and practise, and shall destroy mighty men, and the holy people.
And the yoke of his chain shall prosper: there is craft in his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by craft shall destroy many, and he shall stand up for the destruction of many, and shall crush them as eggs in his hand.
And the vision of the evening and morning that was mentioned is true: and do thou seal the vision; for it is for many days.
And I Daniel fell asleep, and was sick: then I arose, and did the king's business; and I wondered at the vision, and there was none that understood it.
Wisdom lifteth up the head of him that is of low degree, and maketh him to sit among great men.
Commend not a man for his beauty; neither abhor a man for his outward appearance.
The bee is little among such as fly; but her fruit is the chief of sweet things.
Boast not of thy clothing and raiment, and exalt not thyself in the day of honour: for the works of the Lord are wonderful, and his works among men are hidden.
Many kings have sat down upon the ground; and one that was never thought of hath worn the crown.
Many mighty men have been greatly disgraced; and the honourable delivered into other men's hands.
Blame not before thou hast examined the truth: understand first, and then rebuke.
Answer not before thou hast heard the cause: neither interrupt men in the midst of their talk.
Strive not in a matter that concerneth thee not; and sit not in judgment with sinners.
My son, meddle not with many matters: for if thou meddle much, thou shalt not be innocent; and if thou follow after, thou shalt not obtain, neither shalt thou escape by fleeing.
There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind.
Again, there is another that is slow, and hath need of help, wanting ability, and full of poverty; yet the eye of the Lord looked upon him for good, and set him up from his low estate,
And lifted up his head from misery; so that many that saw from him is peace over all the
Prosperity and adversity, life and death, poverty and riches, come of the Lord.
The gift of the Lord remaineth with the ungodly, and his favour bringeth prosperity for ever.
There is that waxeth rich by his wariness and pinching, and this his the portion of his reward:
Whereas he saith, I have found rest, and now will eat continually of my goods; and yet he knoweth not what time shall come upon him, and that he must leave those things to others, and die.
Be stedfast in thy covenant, and be conversant therein, and wax old in thy work.
Marvel not at the works of sinners; but trust in the Lord, and abide in thy labour: for it is an easy thing in the sight of the Lord on the sudden to make a poor man rich.
The blessing of the Lord is in the reward of the godly, and suddenly he maketh his blessing flourish.
Say not, What profit is there of my service? and what good things shall I have hereafter?
Again, say not, I have enough, and possess many things, and what evil shall I have hereafter?
In the day of prosperity there is a forgetfulness of affliction: and in the day of affliction there is no more remembrance of prosperity.
For it is an easy thing unto the Lord in the day of death to reward a man according to his ways.
The affliction of an hour maketh a man forget pleasure: and in his end his deeds shall be discovered.
Judge none blessed before his death: for a man shall be known in his children.
Bring not every man into thine house: for the deceitful man hath many trains.
Like as a partridge taken and kept in a cage, so is the heart of the proud; and like as a spy, watcheth he for thy fall:
For he lieth in wait, and turneth good into evil, and in things worthy praise will lay blame upon thee.
Of a spark of fire a heap of coals is kindled: and a sinful man layeth wait for blood.
Take heed of a mischievous man, for he worketh wickedness; lest he bring upon thee a perpetual blot.
Receive a stranger into thine house, and he will disturb thee, and turn thee out of thine own.
and oppress not the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, and go not after strange gods to your hurt:
then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land which I gave to your fathers of old and for ever.
But whereas ye have trusted in lying words, whereby ye shall not be profited;
and ye murder, and commit adultery, and steal, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and are gone after strange gods whom ye know not,
so that it is evil with you; yet have ye come, and stood before me in the house, whereon my name is called, and ye have said, We have refrained from doing all these abominations.
Their children gather wood, and their fathers kindle a fire, and their women knead dough, to make cakes to the host of heaven; and they have poured out drink-offerings to strange gods, that they might provoke me to anger.
Thus saith the Lord, Gather your whole-burnt-offerings with your meat-offerings, and eat flesh.
Cut off thine hair, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on thy lips; for the Lord has reprobated and rejected the generation that does these things.
And they have built the altar of Tapheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their sons and their daughters with fire; which I did not command them to do, neither did I design it in my heart.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Charge the children of Israel, and thou shalt speak to them, saying, Ye shall observe to offer to me in my feasts my gifts, my presents, my burnt-offerings for a sweet-smelling savour.
And thou shalt say to them, These are the burnt-offerings, all that ye shall bring to the Lord; two lambs of a year old without blemish daily, for a whole-burnt offering perpetually.
Thou shalt offer one lamb in the morning, and thou shalt offer the second lamb towards evening.
And thou shalt offer the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat-offering, mingled with oil, with the fourth part of a hin.
It is a perpetual whole-burnt-offering, a sacrifice offered in the mount of Sina for a sweet-smelling savour to the Lord.
And its drink-offering, the fourth part of a hin to each lamb; in the holy place shalt thou pour strong drink as a drink-offering to the Lord.
And the second lamb thou shalt offer toward evening; thou shalt offer it according to its meat-offering and according to its drink-offering for a smell of sweet savour to the Lord.
And on the sabbath-day ye shall offer two lambs of a year old without blemish, and two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat-offering, and a drink-offering.
It is a whole-burnt-offering of the sabbaths on the sabbath days, besides the continued whole-burnt-offering, and its drink offering.
And at the new moons ye shall bring a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord, two calves of the herd, and one ram, seven lambs of a year old without blemish.
Three tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil for one calf, and two tenth deals of fine flour mingled with oil for one ram.
A tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for each lamb, as a meat-offering, a sweet-smelling savour, a burnt-offering to the Lord.
Their drink-offering shall be the half of a hin for one calf; and the third of a hin for one ram; and the fourth part of a hin of wine for one lamb: this is the whole-burnt-offering monthly throughout the months of the year.
And he shall offer one kid of the goats for a sin-offering to the Lord; it shall be offered beside the continual whole-burnt-offering and its drink-offering.
And in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, is the passover to the Lord.
And on the fifteenth day of this month is a feast; seven days ye shall eat unleavened bread.
And the first day shall be to you a holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work.
And ye shall bring whole-burnt-offerings, a sacrifice to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, seven lambs of a year old; they shall be to you without blemish.
My son, if thou become surety for thy friend, thou shalt deliver thine hand to an enemy.
For a man's own lips become a strong snare to him, and he is caught with the lips of his own mouth.
My son, do what I command thee, and deliver thyself; for on thy friend's account thou art come into the power of evil men: faint not, but stir up even thy friend for whom thou art become surety.
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber with thine eyelids;
that thou mayest deliver thyself as a doe out of the toils, and as a bird out of a snare.
Go to the ant, O sluggard; and see, and emulate his ways, and become wiser than he.
For whereas he has no husbandry, nor any one to compel him, and is under no master,
he prepares food for himself in the summer, and lays by abundant store in harvest. Or go to the bee, and learn how diligent she is, and how earnestly she is engaged in her work; whose labours kings and private men use for health, and she is desired and respected by all: though weak in body, she is advanced by honouring wisdom.
How long wilt thou lie, O sluggard? and when wilt thou awake out of sleep?
Thou sleepest a little, and thou restest a little, and thou slumberest a short time, and thou foldest thine arms over thy breast a little.
Then poverty comes upon thee as an evil traveller, and want as a swift courier: but if thou be diligent, thine harvest shall arrive as a fountain, and poverty shall flee away as a bad courier.
A foolish man and a transgressor goes in ways that are not good.
And the same winks with the eye, and makes a sign with his foot, and teaches with the beckonings of his fingers.
His perverse heart devises evils: at all times such a one causes troubles to a city.
Therefore his destruction shall come suddenly; overthrow and irretrievable ruin.
For he rejoices in all things which God hates, and he is ruined by reason of impurity of soul.
The eye of the haughty, a tongue unjust, hands shedding the blood of the just;
and a heart devising evil thoughts, and feet hastening to do evil, are hateful to God.
An unjust witness kindles falsehoods, and brings on quarrels between brethren.
My son, keep the laws of thy father, and reject not the ordinances of thy mother:
but bind them upon thy soul continually, and hang them as a chain about thy neck.
Whensoever thou walkest, lead this along and let it be with thee; that it may talk with thee when thou wakest.
For the commandment of the law is a lamp and a light; a way of life; reproof also and correction:
to keep thee continually from a married woman, and from the calumny of a strange tongue.
Let not the desire of beauty overcome thee, neither be thou caught by thine eyes, neither be captivated with her eyelids.
For the value of a harlot is as much as of one loaf; and a woman hunts for the precious souls of men.
Shall any one bind fire in his bosom, and not burn his garments?
or will any one walk on coals of fire, and not burn his feet?
So is he that goes in to a married woman; he shall not be held guiltless, neither any one that touches her.
It is not to be wondered at if one should be taken stealing, for he steals that when hungry he may satisfy his soul:
but if he should be taken, he shall repay sevenfold, and shall deliver himself by giving all his goods.
But the adulterer through want of sense procures destruction to his soul.
He endures both pain and disgrace, and his reproach shall never be wiped off.
For the soul of her husband is full of jealousy: he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
He will not forego his enmity for any ransom: neither will he be reconciled for many gifts.
And it came to pass, when Jeremias ceased speaking to the people all the words of the Lord, for which the Lord had sent him to them, even all these words,
that Azarias son of Maasaeas spoke, and Joanan, the son of Caree, and all the men who had spoken to Jeremias, saying, It is false: the Lord has not sent thee to us, saying, Enter not into Egypt to dwell there:
but Baruch the son of Nerias sets thee against us, that thou mayest deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, and that we should be carried away captives to Babylon.
So Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, and all the people, refused to hearken to the voice of the Lord, to dwell in the land of Juda.
And Joanan, and all the leaders of the host, took all the remnant of Juda, who had returned to dwell in the land;
the mighty men, and the women, and the children that were left, and the daughters of the king, and the souls which Nabuzardan had left with Godolias the son of Achicam and Jeremias the prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerias.
And they came into Egypt: for they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord: and they entered into Taphnas.
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in Taphnas, saying,
Take thee great stones, and hide them in the entrance, at the gate of the house of Pharao in Taphnas, in the sight of the men of Juda:
and thou shalt say, Thus has the Lord said; Behold, I will send, and will bring Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and he shall place his throne upon these stones which thou hast hidden, and he shall lift up weapons against them.
And he shall enter in, and smite the land of Egypt, delivering some for death to death; and some for captivity to captivity; and some for the sword to the sword.
And he shall kindle a fire in the houses of their gods, and shall burn them, and shall carry them away captives: and shall search the land of Egypt, as a shepherd searches his garment; and he shall go forth in peace.
And he shall break to pieces the pillars of Heliopolis that are in On, and shall burn their houses with fire.
Then the angel of the Lord answered and said, O Lord Almighty, how long wilt thou have no mercy on Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, which thou has disregarded these seventy years?
And the Lord Almighty answered the angel that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings.
And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry out and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy.
And I am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack her: forasmuch as I indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack her for evil.
Therefore thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house shall be rebuilt in her, saith the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet be stretched out over Jerusalem.
And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet shall cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the Lord shall yet have mercy upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem.
And I lifted up mine eyes and looked, and behold four horns.
And I said to the angel that spoke with me, What are these things, my lord? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and Jerusalem.
A wise son makes his father glad: but a foolish son is a grief to his mother.
Treasures shall not profit the lawless: but righteousness shall deliver from death.
The Lord will not famish a righteous soul: but he will overthrow the life of the ungodly.
Poverty brings a man low: but the hands of the vigorous make rich. A son who is instructed shall be wise, and shall use the fool for a servant.
A wise son is saved from heat: but a lawless son is blighted of the winds in harvest.
The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the just: but untimely grief shall cover the mouth of the ungodly.
The memory of the just is praised; but the name of the ungodly man is extinguished.
A wise man in heart will receive commandments; but he that is unguarded in his lips shall be overthrown in his perverseness.
He that walks simply, walks confidently; but he that perverts his ways shall be known.
He that winks with his eyes deceitfully, procures griefs for men; but he that reproves boldly is a peacemaker.
There is a fountain of life in the hand of a righteous man; but destruction shall cover the mouth of the ungodly.
Hatred stirs up strife; but affection covers all that do not love strife.
He that brings forth wisdom from his lips smites the fool with a rod.
The wise will hide discretion; but the mouth of the hasty draws near to ruin.
The wealth of rich men is a strong city; but poverty is the ruin of the ungodly.
The works of the righteous produce life; but the fruits of the ungodly produce sins.
Instruction keeps the right ways of life; but instruction unchastened goes astray.
Righteous lips cover enmity; but they that utter railings are most foolish.
By a multitude of words thou shalt not escape sin; but if thou refrain thy lips thou wilt be prudent.
The tongue of the just is tried silver; but the heart of the ungodly shall fail.
The lips of the righteous know sublime truths: but the foolish die in want.
The blessing of the Lord is upon the head of the righteous; it enriches him, and grief of heart shall not be added to it.
A fool does mischief in sport; but wisdom brings forth prudence for a man.
The ungodly is engulphed in destruction; but the desire of the righteous is acceptable.
When the storm passes by, the ungodly vanishes away; but the righteous turns aside and escapes for ever.
As a sour grape is hurtful to the teeth, and smoke to the eyes, so iniquity hurts those that practise it.
The fear of the Lord adds length of days: but the years of the ungodly shall be shortened.
Joy rests long with the righteous: but the hope of the ungodly shall perish.
The fear of the Lord is a strong hold of the saints: but ruin comes to them that work wickedness.
The righteous shall never fail: but the ungodly shall not dwell in the earth.
The mouth of the righteous drops wisdom: but the tongue of the unjust shall perish.
The lips of just men drop grace: but the mouth of the ungodly is perverse.
And God remembered Noe, and all the wild beasts, and all the cattle, and all the birds, and all the reptiles that creep, as many as were with him in the ark, and God brought a wind upon the earth, and the water stayed.
And the fountains of the deep were closed up, and the flood-gates of heaven, and the rain from heaven was withheld.
And the water subsided, and went off the earth, and after an hundred and fifty days the water was diminished, and the ark rested in the seventh month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, on the mountains of Ararat.
And the water continued to decrease until the tenth month.
And in the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the heads of the mountains were seen.
And it came to pass after forty days Noe opened the window of the ark which he had made.
And he sent forth a raven; and it went forth and returned not until the water was dried from off the earth.
And he sent a dove after it to see if the water had ceased from off the earth.
And the dove not having found rest for her feet, returned to him into the ark, because the water was on all the face of the earth, and he stretched out his hand and took her, and brought her to himself into the ark.
And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove from the ark.
And the dove returned to him in the evening, and had a leaf of olive, a sprig in her mouth; and Noe knew that the water had ceased from off the earth.
And having waited yet seven other days, he again sent forth the dove, and she did not return to him again any more.
And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year of the life of Noe, in the first month, on the first day of the month, the water subsided from off the earth, and Noe opened the covering of the ark which he had made, and he saw that the water had subsided from the face of the earth.
And Noe built an altar to the Lord, and took of all clean beasts, and of all clean birds, and offered a whole burnt-offering upon the altar.
And the Lord God smelled a smell of sweetness, and the Lord God having considered, said, I will not any more curse the earth, because of the works of men, because the imagination of man is intently bent upon evil things from his youth, I will not therefore any more smite all living flesh as I have done.
All the days of the earth, seed and harvest, cold and heat, summer and spring, shall not cease by day or night.
And the Philistines gather all their armies to Aphec, and Israel encamped in Aendor, which is in Jezrael.
And the lords of the Philistines went on by hundreds and thousands, and David and his men went on in the rear with Anchus.
And the lords of the Philistines said, Who are these that pass by? And Anchus said to the captains of the Philistines, Is not this David the servant of Saul king of Israel? He has been with us some time, even this second year, and I have not found any fault in him from the day that he attached himself to me even until this day.
And the captains of the Philistines were displeased at him, and they say to him, Send the man away, and let him return to his place, where thou didst set him; and let him not come with us to the war, and let him not be a traitor in the camp: and wherewith will he be reconciled to his master? Will it not be with the heads of those men?
Is not this David whom they celebrated in dances, saying, Saul has smitten his thousands, and David his ten thousands?
And Anchus called David, and said to him, As the Lord lives, thou art right and approved in my eyes, and so is thy going out and thy coming in with me in the army, and I have not found any evil to charge against thee from the day that thou camest to me until this day: but thou art not approved in the eyes of the lords.
Now then return and go in peace, thus thou shalt not do evil in the sight of the lords of the Philistines.
And David said to Anchus, What have I done to thee? and what hast thou found in thy servant from the first day that I was before thee even until this day, that I should not come and war against the enemies of the lord my king?
And Anchus answered David, I know that thou art good in my eyes, but the lords of the Philistines say, He shall not come with us to the war.
Now then rise up early in the morning, thou and the servants of thy lord that are come with thee, and go to the place where I appointed you, and entertain no evil thought in thy heart, for thou art good in my sight: and rise early for your journey when it is light, and depart.
So David arose early, he and his men, to depart and guard the land of the Philistines: and the Philistines went up to Jezrael to battle.
And it came to pass in the ninth month of Sedekias king of Juda, that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.
And in the eleventh year of Sedekiass, in the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up.
And all the leaders of the king of Babylon went in, and sat in the middle gate, Marganasar, and Samagoth, and Nabusachar, and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the leaders of the king of Babylon,
and they sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison, and gave him in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan: and they brought him out, and he sat in the midst of the people.
And the word of the Lord came to Jeremias in the court of the prison, saying,
Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good.
But I will save thee in that day, and I will by no means deliver thee into the hands of the men before whom thou art afraid.
For I will surely save thee, and thou shalt by no means fall by the sword; and thou shalt find thy life, because thou didst trust in me, saith the Lord.
In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of Dan sought for itself an inheritance to inhabit, because no inheritance had fallen to it until that day in the midst of the tribes of the children of Israel.
And the sons of Dan sent from their families five men of valour, from Saraa and from Esthaol, to spy out the land and to search it; and they said to them, Go and search out the land. And they came as far as the mount of Ephraim to the house of Michaias and they lodged there,
in the house of Michaias, and they recognised the voice of the young man the Levite, and turned in thither; and said to him, Who brought thee in hither? and what doest thou in this place? and what hast thou here?
And he said to them, Thus and thus did Michaias to me, and he hired me, and I became his priest.
And they said to him, Enquire now of God, and we shall know whether our way will prosper, on which we are going.
And the priest said to them, Go in peace; your way in which ye go, is before the Lord.
And the five men went on, and came to Laisa; and they saw the people in the midst of it dwelling securely, at ease as is the manner of the Sidonians, and there is no one perverting or shaming a matter in the land, no heir extorting treasures; and they are far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with any one.
They went some distance from the house of Michaias, and, behold, Michaias and the men in the houses near Michaias' house, cried out, and overtook the children of 27.
And the children of Dan turned their face, and said to Michaias, What is the matter with thee that thou hast cried out?
And Michaias said, Because ye have taken my graven image which I made, and my priest, and are gone; and what have I remaining? and what is this that ye say to me, Why criest thou?
And the children of Dan said to him, Let not thy voice be heard with us, lest angry men run upon thee, and take away thy life, and the lives of thy house.
And the children of Dan went their way; and Michaias saw that they were stronger than himself, and he returned to his house.
And the children of Dan took what Michaias had made, and the priest that he had, and they came to Laisa, to a people quiet and secure; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.
And there was no deliverer, because the city is far from the Sidonians, and they have no intercourse with men, and it is in the valley of the house of Raab; and they built the city, and dwelt in it.
And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel; and the name of the city was Ulamais before.
And the children of Dan set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan son of Gerson son of Manasse, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan till the time of the carrying away of the nation.
And they set up for themselves the graven image which Michaias made, all the days that the house of God was in Selom; and it was so in those days that there was no king in Israel.
And if one be found slain with the sword in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, having fallen in the field, and they do not know who has smitten him;
thine elders and thy judges shall come forth, and shall measure the distances of the cities round about the slain man:
and it shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not laboured, and which has not borne a yoke.
And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer into a rough valley, which has not been tilled and is not sown, and they shall slay the heifer in the valley.
And the priests the Levites shall come, because the Lord God has chosen them to stand by him, and to bless in his name, and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be decided.
Come, let us exult in the Lord; let us make a joyful noise to God our Saviour.
Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a joyful noise to him with psalms.
For the Lord is a great God, and a great king over all gods: for the Lord will not cast off his people.
For the ends of the earth are in his hands; and the heights of the mountains are his.
For the sea is his, and he made it: and is hands formed the dry land.
Come, let us worship and fall down before him; and weep before the Lord that made us.
For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand.
To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, according to the day of irritation in the wilderness:
where your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works.
Forty years was I grieved with this generation, and said, They do always err in their heart, and they have not known my ways.
So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.
In the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the Lord spoke by Aggaeus the prophet, saying,
Speak now to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying,
Who is there of you that saw this house in her former glory? and how do ye now look upon it, as it were nothing before your eyes?
Yet now be strong, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord; and strengthen thyself, O Jesus the high priest, the son of Josedec; and let all the people of the land strengthen themselves, saith the Lord, and work, for I am with you, saith the Lord Almighty;
and my Spirit remains in the midst of you; be of good courage.
For thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet once I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
and I will shake all nations, and the choice portions of all the nations shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty.
Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, saith the Lord Almighty.
For the glory of this house shall be great, the latter more than the former, saith the Lord Almighty: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord Almighty, even peace of soul for a possession to every one that builds, to raise up this temple.
On the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Aggaeus the prophet, saying,
Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Inquire now of the priest concerning the law, saying,
If a man should take holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and the skirt of his garment should touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.
And Aggaeus said, If a defiled person who is unclean by reason of a dead body, touch any of these, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered and said, It shall be defiled.
And Aggaeus answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so are all the works of their hands: and whosoever shall approach them, shall be defiled because of their early burdens: they shall be pained because of their toils; and ye have hated him that reproved in the gates.
And now consider, I pray you, from this day and beforetime, before they laid a stone on a stone in the temple of the Lord, what manner of men ye were.
When ye cast into the corn-bin twenty measures of barley, and there were only ten measures of barley: and ye went to the vat to draw out fifty measures, and there were but twenty.
I smote you with barrenness, and with blasting, and all the works of your hands with hail; yet ye returned not to me, saith the Lord.
Set your hearts now to think from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day when the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid;
consider in your hearts, whether this shall be known on the corn-floor, and whether yet the vine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-trees that bear no fruit are with you: from this day will I bless you.
And the word of the Lord came the second time to Aggaeus the prophet, on the four and twentieth day of the month, saying,
Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, saying, I shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land;
and I will overthrow the thrones of kings, and I will destroy the power of the kings of the nations; and I will overthrow chariots and riders; and the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the sword striving against his brother.
Why has my beloved wrought abomination in my house? will prayers and holy offerings take away thy wickedness from thee, or shalt thou escape by these things?
The Lord called thy name a fair olive tree, of a goodly shade in appearance, at the noise of its being lopped, fire was kindled against it; great is the affliction coming upon thee: her branches are become good for nothing.
O Lord, teach me, and I shall know: then I saw their practices.
But I as an innocent lamb led to the slaughter, knew not: against me they devised an evil device, saying, Come and let us put wood into his bread, and let us utterly destroy him from off the land of the living, and let his name not be remembered any more.
O Lord, that judgest righteously, trying the reins and hearts, let me see thy vengeance taken upon them, for to thee I have declared my cause.
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek my life, that say, Thou shalt not prophesy at all in the name of the Lord, but if thou dost, thou shalt die by our hands:
behold, I will visit them: their young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall die of famine:
and there shall be no remnant left of them; for I will bring evil upon the dwellers in Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.
Do no evil, so shall no harm come unto thee.
Depart from the unjust, and iniquity shall turn away from thee.
My son, sow not upon the furrows of unrighteousness, and thou shalt not reap them sevenfold.
Seek not of the Lord preeminence, neither of the king the seat of honour.
justify not thyself before the Lord; and boast not of thy wisdom before the king.
Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness.
Offend not against the multitude of a city, and then thou shalt not cast thyself down among the people.
Bind not one sin upon another; for in one thou shalt not be unpunished.
Say not, God will look upon the multitude of my oblations, and when I offer to the most high God, he will accept it.
Be not fainthearted when thou makest thy prayer, and neglect not to give alms.
Laugh no man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is one which humbleth and exalteth.
Devise not a lie against thy brother; neither do the like to thy friend.
Use not to make any manner of lie: for the custom thereof is not good.
Use not many words in a multitude of elders, and make not much babbling when thou prayest.
Hate not laborious work, neither husbandry, which the most High hath ordained.
Number not thyself among the multitude of sinners, but remember that wrath will not tarry long.
Humble thyself greatly: for the vengeance of the ungodly is fire and worms.
Change not a friend for any good by no means; neither a faithful brother for the gold of Ophir.
Forego not a wise and good woman: for her grace is above gold.
Whereas thy servant worketh truly, entreat him not evil. nor the hireling that bestoweth himself wholly for thee.
Let thy soul love a good servant, and defraud him not of liberty.
Hast thou cattle? have an eye to them: and if they be for thy profit, keep them with thee.
Hast thou children? instruct them, and bow down their neck from their youth.
Hast thou daughters? have a care of their body, and shew not thyself cheerful toward them.
Marry thy daughter, and so shalt thou have performed a weighty matter: but give her to a man of understanding.
Hast thou a wife after thy mind? forsake her not: but give not thyself over to a light woman.
Honour thy father with thy whole heart, and forget not the sorrows of thy mother.
Remember that thou wast begotten of them; and how canst thou recompense them the things that they have done for thee?
Fear the Lord with all thy soul, and reverence his priests.
Love him that made thee with all thy strength, and forsake not his ministers.
Fear the Lord, and honour the priest; and give him his portion, as it is commanded thee; the firstfruits, and the trespass offering, and the gift of the shoulders, and the sacrifice of sanctification, and the firstfruits of the holy things.
And stretch thine hand unto the poor, that thy blessing may be perfected.
A gift hath grace in the sight of every man living; and for the dead detain it not.
Fail not to be with them that weep, and mourn with them that mourn.
Be not slow to visit the sick: fir that shall make thee to be beloved.
Whatsoever thou takest in hand, remember the end, and thou shalt never do amiss.
And if thou shouldest go forth to war against thine enemies, and shouldest see horse, and rider, and a people more numerous than thyself; thou shalt not be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God is with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.
And it shall come to pass whenever thou shalt draw nigh to battle, that the priest shall draw nigh and speak to the people, and shall say to them,
Hear, O Israel; ye are going this day to battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, neither be confounded, neither turn aside from their face.
For it is the Lord your God who advances with you, to fight with you against your enemies, and to save you.
And the scribes shall speak to the people, saying, What man is he that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man dedicate it.
And what man is he that has planted a vineyard, and not been made merry with it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man be made merry with it.
And what man is he that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.
Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.
Sing to the Lord, bless his name: proclaim his salvation from day to day.
Publish his glory among the Gentiles, his wonderful works among all people.
For the Lord is great, and greatly to be praised: he is terrible above all gods.
For all the gods of the heathen are devils: but the Lord made the heavens.
Thanksgiving and beauty are before him: holiness and majesty are in his sanctuary.
Bring to the Lord, ye families of the Gentiles, bring to the Lord glory and honour.
Bring to the Lord the glory becoming his name: take offerings, and go into his courts.
Worship the Lord in his holy court: let all the earth tremble before him.
Say among the heathen, The Lord reigns: for he has established the world so that it shall not be moved: he shall judge the people in righteousness.
Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth exult; let the sea be moved, and the fullness of it.
The plains shall rejoice, and all things in them: then shall all the trees of the wood exult before the presence of the Lord:
for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth; he shall judge the world in righteousness, and the people with his truth.
Hear ye the word of the Lord, which he has spoken to you, O house of Israel.
Thus saith the Lord, Learn ye not the ways of the heathen, and be not alarmed at the signs of the sky; for they are alarmed at them, falling on their faces.
For the customs of the nations are vain; it is a tree cut out of the forest, the work of the carpenter, or a molten image.
They are beautified with silver and gold, they fix them with hammers and nails;
they will set them up that they may not move; it is wrought silver, they will not walk, it is forged silver They must certainly be borne, for they cannot ride of themselves. Fear them not; for they cannot do any evil, and there is no good in them.
Thus shall ye say to them, Let the gods which have not made heaven and earth perish from off the earth, and from under this sky.
It is the Lord that made the earth by his strength, who set up the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding stretched out the sky,
and set abundance of waters in the sky, and brought up clouds from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain, and brought forth light out of his treasures.
Every man is deprived of knowledge, every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven images; for he has cast false gods, there is no breath in them.
They are vain works, wrought in mockery; in the time of their visitation they shall perish.
Such is not the portion of Jacob; for he that formed all things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.
He has gathered thy substance from without the lodged in choice vessels.
For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will overthrow the inhabitants of this land with affliction, that thy plague may be discovered.
Chasten us, O Lord, but with judgment; and not in wrath, lest thou make us few.
Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the families that have not called upon thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, and consumed him, and have made his pasture desolate.
Extol not thyself in the counsel of thine own heart; that thy soul be not torn in pieces as a bull straying alone.
Thou shalt eat up thy leaves, and lose thy fruit, and leave thyself as a dry tree.
A wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and shall make him to be laughed to scorn of his enemies.
Sweet language will multiply friends: and a fairspeaking tongue will increase kind greetings.
Be in peace with many: nevertheless have but one counsellor of a thousand.
If thou wouldest get a friend, prove him first and be not hasty to credit him.
For some man is a friend for his own occasion, and will not abide in the day of thy trouble.
And there is a friend, who being turned to enmity, and strife will discover thy reproach.
Again, some friend is a companion at the table, and will not continue in the day of thy affliction.
But in thy prosperity he will be as thyself, and will be bold over thy servants.
If thou be brought low, he will be against thee, and will hide himself from thy face.
Separate thyself from thine enemies, and take heed of thy friends.
A faithful friend is a strong defence: and he that hath found such an one hath found a treasure.
Nothing doth countervail a faithful friend, and his excellency is invaluable.
A faithful friend is the medicine of life; and they that fear the Lord shall find him.
Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.
My son, gather instruction from thy youth up: so shalt thou find wisdom till thine old age.
Come unto her as one that ploweth and soweth, and wait for her good fruits: for thou shalt not toil much in labouring about her, but thou shalt eat of her fruits right soon.
She is very unpleasant to the unlearned: he that is without understanding will not remain with her.
She will lie upon him as a mighty stone of trial; and he will cast her from him ere it be long.
For wisdom is according to her name, and she is not manifest unto many.
Give ear, my son, receive my advice, and refuse not my counsel,
And put thy feet into her fetters, and thy neck into her chain.
Bow down thy shoulder, and bear her, and be not grieved with her bonds.
Come unto her with thy whole heart, and keep her ways with all thy power.
Search, and seek, and she shall be made known unto thee: and when thou hast got hold of her, let her not go.
For at the last thou shalt find her rest, and that shall be turned to thy joy.
Then shall her fetters be a strong defence for thee, and her chains a robe of glory.
For there is a golden ornament upon her, and her bands are purple lace.
Thou shalt put her on as a robe of honour, and shalt put her about thee as a crown of joy.
My son, if thou wilt, thou shalt be taught: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be prudent.
If thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding: and if thou bow thine ear, thou shalt be wise,
Stand in the multitude of the elders; and cleave unto him that is wise.
Be willing to hear every godly discourse; and let not the parables of understanding escape thee.
And if thou seest a man of understanding, get thee betimes unto him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his door.
Let thy mind be upon the ordinances of the Lord and meditate continually in his commandments: he shall establish thine heart, and give thee wisdom at thine owns desire.
And there was a Levite sojourning in the sides of mount Ephraim, and he took to himself a concubine from Bethleem Juda.
And his concubine departed from him, and went away from him to the house of her father to Bethleem Juda, and she was there four months.
And her husband rose up, and went after her to speak kindly to her, to recover her to himself; and he had his young man with him, and a pair of asses; and she brought him into the house of her father; and the father of the damsel saw him, and was well pleased to meet him.
And his father-in-law, the father of the damsel, constrained him, and he stayed with him for three days; and they ate and drank, and lodged there.
And it came to pass on the fourth day that they rose early, and he stood up to depart; and the father of the damsel said to his son-in-law, Strengthen thy heart with a morsel of bread, and afterwards ye shall go.
So they two sat down together and ate and drank: and the father of the damsel said to her husband, Tarry now the night, and let thy heart be merry.
And the man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law constrained him, and he stayed and lodged there.
And behold, an old man came out of the field from his work in the evening; and the man was of mount Ephraim, and he sojourned in Gabaa, and the men of the place were sons of Benjamin.
And he lifted up his eyes, and saw a traveller in the street of the city; and the old man said to him, Whither goest thou, and whence comest thou?
And he said to him, We are passing by from Bethleem Juda to the sides of mount Ephraim: I am from thence, and I went as far as Bethleem Juda, and I am going home, and there is no man to take me into his house.
Yet is there straw and food for our asses, and bread and wine for me and my handmaid and the young man with thy servants; there is no want of anything.
And the old man said, Peace be to thee; only be every want of thine upon me, only do thou by no means lodge in the street.
And he brought him into his house, and made room for his asses; and they washed their feet, and ate and drank.
And they were comforting their heart, when, behold, the men of the city, sons of transgressors, compassed the house, knocking at the door: and they spoke to the old man the owner of the house, saying, Bring out the man who came into thy house, that we may know him.
And the master of the house came out to them, and said, Nay, brethren, do not ye wrong, I pray you, after this man has come into my house; do not ye this folly.
Behold my daughter a virgin, and the man's concubine: I will bring them out, and humble ye them, and do to them that which is good in your eyes; but to this man do not this folly.
But the men would not consent to hearken to him; so the man laid hold of his concubine, and brought her out to them; and they knew her, and abused her all night till the morning, and let her go when the morning dawned.
And the woman came toward morning, and fell down at the door of the house where her husband was, until it was light.
And her husband rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of the house, and went forth to go on his journey; and, behold, the woman his concubine had fallen down by the doors of the house, and her hands were on the threshold.
And he said to her, Rise, and let us go; and she answered not, for she was dead: and he took her upon his ass, and went to his place.
And he took his sword, and laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve parts, and sent them to every coast of Israel.
And it was so, that every one who saw it said, Such a day as this has not happened nor has been seen from the day of the going up of the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt until this day: take ye counsel concerning it, and speak.
And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together with their armies to go out to fight with Israel; and Anchus said to David, Know surely, that thou shalt go forth to battle with me, thou, and thy men.
And David said to Anchus, Thus now thou shalt know what thy servant will do. And Anchus said to David, So will I make thee captain of my body-guard continually.
And Samuel died, and all Israel lamented for him, and they bury him in his city, in Armathaim. And Saul had removed those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.
And the Philistines assemble themselves, and come and encamp in Sonam: and Saul gathers all the men of Israel, and they encamp in Gelbue.
And Saul saw the camp of the Philistines, and he was alarmed, and his heart was greatly dismayed.
And Saul enquired of the Lord; and the Lord answered him not by dreams, nor by manifestations, nor by prophets.
Then Saul said to his servants, Seek for me a woman who has in her a divining spirit, and I will go to her, and enquire of her: and his servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has in her a divining spirit at Aendor.
And Saul disguised himself, and put on other raiment, and he goes, and two men with him, and they come to the woman by night; and he said to her, Divine to me, I pray thee, by the divining spirit within thee, and bring up to me him whom I shall name to thee.
And the woman said to him, Behold now, thou knowest what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who had in them divining spirits, and the wizards from the land, and why dost thou spread a snare for my life to destroy it?
And Saul swore to her, and said, As the Lord lives, no injury shall come upon thee on this account.
And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up to thee? and he said, Bring up to me Samuel.
And the woman saw Samuel, and cried out with a loud voice: and the woman said to Saul, Why hast thou deceived me? for thou art Saul.
And the king said to her, Fear not; tell me whom thou has seen. And the woman said to him, I saw gods ascending out of the earth.
And he said to her, What didst thou perceive? and she said to him, An upright man ascending out of the earth, and he was clothed with a mantle. And Saul knew that this was Samuel, and he stooped with his face to the earth, and did obeisance to him.
And Samuel said, Why hast thou troubled me, that I should come up? And Saul said, I am greatly distressed, and the Philistines war against me, and God has departed from me, and no longer hearkens to me either by the hand of the prophets or by dreams: and now I have called thee to tell me what I shall do.
And Samuel said, Why askest thou me, whereas the Lord has departed from thee, and taken part with thy neighbour?
And the Lord has done to thee, as the Lord spoke by me; and the Lord will rend thy kingdom out of thy hand, and will give it to thy neighbour David.
because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and didst not execute his fierce anger upon Amalec, therefore the Lord has done this thing to thee this day.
And the Lord shall deliver Israel with thee into the hands of the Philistines, and to-morrow thou and thy sons with thee shall fall, and the Lord shall deliver the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.
And Saul instantly fell at his full length upon the earth, and was greatly afraid because of the words of Samuel; and there was no longer any strength in him, for he had eaten no bread all that day, and all that night.
And the woman went in to Saul, and saw that he was greatly disquieted, and said to him, Behold now, thine handmaid has hearkened to thy voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have heard the words which thou has spoken to me.
And now hearken, I pray thee, to the voice of thine handmaid, and I will set before thee a morsel of bread, and eat, and thou shalt be strengthened, for thou wilt be going on thy way.
But he would not eat; so his servants and the woman constrained him, and he hearkened to their voice, and rose up from the earth, and sat upon a bench.
And the woman had a fat heifer in the house; and she hasted and slew it; and she took meal and kneaded it, and baked unleavened cakes.
And she brought the meat before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate, and rose up, and departed that night.
The word that came from the Lord to Jeremias, after that Nabuzardan the captain of the guard had let him go out of Rama, when he had taken him in manacles in the midst of the captivity of Juda, even those who were carried to Babylon.
And the chief captain of the guard took him, and said to him, The Lord thy God has pronounced all these evils upon this place:
and the Lord has done it; because ye sinned against him, and hearkened not to his voice.
Behold, I have loosed thee from the manacles that were upon thine hands. If it seem good to thee to go with me to Babylon, then will I set mine eyes upon thee.
But if not, depart; return to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of Juda, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Juda: to whatsoever places it seems good in thine eyes to go, do thou even go. And the captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go.
And he came to Godolias to Massepha, and dwelt in the midst of his people that was left in the land.
And all the leaders of the host that was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias governor in the land, and they committed to him the men and their wives, whom Nabuchodonosor had not removed to Babylon.
And there came to Godolias to Massepha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Joanan son of Caree, and Saraeas the son of Thanaemeth, and the sons of Jophe the Netophathite, and Ezonias son of the Mochathite, they and their men.
And Godolias swore to them and to their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.
And, behold, I dwell in your presence at Massepha, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do ye gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put them into your vessels, and dwell in the cities which ye have obtained possession of.
And all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and those that were in Idumea, and those that were in all the rest of the country, heard that the king of Babylon had granted a remnant to Juda, and that he had appointed over them Godolias the son of Achicam.
And they came to Godolias into the land of Juda, to Massepha, and gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.
And Joanan the son of Caree, and all the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Godolias to Massepha,
and said to him, Dost thou indeed know that king Beleissa son of Ammon has sent Ismael to thee to slay thee? But Godolias believed them not.
And Joanan said to Godolias secretly in Massepha, I will go now and smite Ismael, and let no man know it; lest he slay thee, and all the Jews that are gathered to thee be dispersed, and the remnant of Juda perish.
But Godolias said to Joanan, Do not the thing, for thou speakest lies concerning Ismael.

And the dread and the fear of you shall be upon all the wild beasts of the earth, on all the birds of the sky, and on all things moving upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea, I have placed them under your power.
For your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of all wild beasts, and I will require the life of man at the hand of brother man.
And behold I establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you,
and with every living creature with you, of birds and of beasts, and with all the wild beasts of the earth, as many as are with you, of all that come out of the ark.
THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS for all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, and for those settled in Magdolo and in Taphnas, and in the land of Pathura, saying,
Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the cities of Juda; and, behold, they are desolate without inhabitants,
because of their wickedness, which they have wrought to provoke me, by going to burn incense to other gods, whom ye knew not.
yet I sent to you my servants the prophets early in the morning, and I sent, saying, Do not ye this abominable thing which I hate.
But they hearkened not to me, and inclined not their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense to strange gods.
So mine anger and my wrath dropped upon them, and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this day.
And now thus has the Lord Almighty said, Wherefore do ye commit these great evils against your souls? to cut off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end that not one of you should be left;
by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, into which ye entered to dwell there, that ye might be cut off, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?
Have ye forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem?
And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.
Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold I do set my face against you
to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.
And I will visit them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:
and there shall not one be preserved of the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but only they that escape.
Then all the men that knew that their wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,
As for the word which thou hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.
For we will surely perform every word that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and so we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.
But since we left off to burn incense to the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by sword and by famine.
And whereas we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?
Then Jeremias answered all the people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him these words for answer, saying,
Did not the Lord remember the incense which ye burned in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, and your kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his heart?
And the Lord could no longer bear you, because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of your abominations which ye wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a waste, and a curse, as at this day;
because of your burning incense, and because of the things wherein ye sinned against the Lord: and ye have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.
And Jeremias said to the people, and to the women, Hear ye the word of the Lord.
Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye women have spoken with your mouth, and ye fulfilled it with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour drink-offerings to her: full well did ye keep to your vows, and ye have indeed performed them.
Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.
For I have watched over them, to hurt them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.
And they that escape the sword shall return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have continued in the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word shall stand.
And this shall be a sign to you, that I will visit you for evil.
Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will give Uaphres king of Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.
THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAS THE PROPHET spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.
Thus has the Lord said to thee, O Baruch.
Whereas thou hast said, Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in groaning, I found no rest;
say thou to him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted.
And wilt thou seek great things for thyself? seek them not: for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but I will give to thee thy life for a spoil in every place whither thou shalt go.
My son, keep my words, and hide with thee my commandments. My son, honour the Lord, and thou shalt be strong; and fear none but him:
keep my commandments, and thou shalt live; and keep my words as the pupils of thine eyes.
And bind them on thy fingers, and write them on the table of thine heart.
Say that wisdom is thy sister, and gain prudence as an acquaintance for thyself;
that she may keep thee from the strange and wicked woman, if she should assail thee with flattering words.
For she looks from a window out of her house into the streets, at one whom she may see of the senseless ones, a young man void of understanding,
passing by the corner in the passages near her house,
and speaking, in the dark of the evening,
when there happens to be the stillness of night and of darkness:
and the woman meets him having the appearance of a harlot, that causes the hearts of young men to flutter.
And she is fickle, and debauched, and her feet abide not at home.
For at one time she wanders without, and at another time she lies in wait in the streets, at every corner.
Then she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said to him,
I have a peace-offering; today I pay my vows:
therefore I came forth to meet thee, desiring thy face; and I have found thee.
I have spread my bed with sheets, and I have covered it with double tapestry from Egypt.
I have sprinkled my couch with saffron, and my house with cinnamon.
Come, and let us enjoy love until the morning; come, and let us embrace in love.
For my husband is not at home, but is gone on a long journey,
having taken in his hand a bundle of money: after many days he will return to his house.
So with much converse she prevailed on him to go astray, and with the snares of her lips forced him from the right path.
And he followed her, being gently led on, and that as an ox is led to the slaughter, and as a dog to bonds, or as a hart shot in the liver with an arrow:
and he hastens as a bird into a snare, not knowing that he is running for his life.
Now then, my son, hearken to me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Let not thine heart turn aside to her ways :
for she has wounded and cast down many, and those whom she has slain are innumerable.
Her house is the way of hell, leading down to the chambers of death.
How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Lord of hosts!
My soul longs, and faints for the courts of the Lord: my heart and my flesh have exulted in the living god.
Yea, the sparrow has found himself a home, and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will praise thee evermore. Pause.
Blessed is the man whose help is of thee, O Lord; in his heart he has purposed to go up
the valley of weeping, to the place which he has appointed, for there the law-giver will grant blessings.
They shall go from strength to strength: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion.
O Lord God of hosts, hear my prayer: hearken, O God of Jacob. Pause.
Behold, O God our defender, and look upon the face of thine anointed.
For one day in thy courts is better than thousands. I would rather be an abject in the house of God, than dwell in the tents of sinners.
For the Lord loves mercy and truth: God will give grace and glory: the Lord will not withhold good things from them that walk in innocence.
O Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that trusts in thee.
Out of the depths have I cried to thee, O Lord.
O Lord, hearken to my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my supplication.
If thou, O Lord, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall stand?
For with thee is forgiveness: for thy name's sake
have I waited for thee, O Lord, my soul has waited for thy word.
My soul has hoped in the Lord; from the morning watch till night.
Let Israel hope in the Lord: for with the Lord is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption.
And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
In the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus, of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldeans,
I Daniel understood by books the number of the years which was the word of the Lord to the prophet Jeremias, even seventy years for the accomplishment of the desolation of Jerusalem.
And I set my face toward the Lord God, to seek him diligently by prayer and supplications, with fastings and sackcloth.
And I prayed to the Lord my God, and confessed, and said, O Lord, the great and wonderful God, keeping thy covenant and thy mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy commandments; we have sinned,
we have done iniquity, we have transgressed, and we have departed and turned aside from thy commandments and from thy judgments:
and we have not hearkened to thy servants the prophets, who spoke in thy name to our kings, and our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.
To thee, O Lord, belongs righteousness, an to us confusion of face, as at this day; to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the earth, wherever thou has scattered them, for the sin which they committed.
In thee, O Lord, is our righteousness, and to us belongs confusion of faced, and to our kings, and to our princes, and to our fathers, forasmuch as we have sinned.
To thee, the Lord our God, belong compassions and forgivenesses, whereas we have departed from thee;
neither have we hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his laws, which he set before us by the hands of his servants the prophets.
Moreover all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have refused to hearken to thy voice; so the curse has come upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.
And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges who judged us, by bringing upon us great evils, such as have not happened under the whole heaven, according to what has happened in Jerusalem.
As it is written in the law of Moses, all these evils have come upon us: yet we have not besought the Lord our God, that we might turn away from our iniquities, and have understanding in all thy truth.
The Lord also has watched, and brought the evils upon us: for the Lord our God is righteous in all his work which he has executed, but we have not hearkened to his voice.
And now, O Lord our God, who broughtest thy people out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and madest to thyself a name, as at this day; we have sinned, we have transgressed.
O Lord, thy mercy is over all: let, I pray thee, thy wrath turn away, and thine anger from thy city Jerusalem, even thy holy mountain: for we have sinned, and because of our iniquities, and those of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach among all that are round about us.
And now, O lord our God, hearken to the prayer of thy servant, and his supplications, and cause thy face to shine on thy desolate sanctuary, for thine own sake, O Lord.
Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes and behold our desolation, and that of thy city on which thy name is called: for we do not bring our pitiful case before thee on the ground of our righteousness, but on the ground of thy manifold compassions, O Lord.
Hearken, O Lord; be propitious, O Lord; attend, O Lord; delay not, O my God, for thine own sake: for thy name is called upon thy city and upon thy people.
And while I was yet speaking, and praying, and confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel, and bringing my pitiful case before the Lord my God concerning the holy mountain;
yea, while I was yet speaking in prayer, behold the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, came flying, and he touched me about the hour of the evening sacrifice.
And he instructed me, and spoke with me, and said, O Daniel, I am now come forth to impart to thee understanding.
At the beginning of thy supplication the word came forth, and I am come to tell thee; for thou art a man much beloved: therefore consider the matter, understand the vision.
Seventy weeks have been determined upon thy people, and upon the holy city, for sin to be ended, and to seal up transgressions, and to blot out the iniquities, and to make atonement for iniquities, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal the vision and the prophet, and to anoint the Most Holy.
And thou shalt know and understand, that from the going forth of the command for the answer and for the building of Jerusalem until Christ the prince there shall be seven weeks, and sixty-two weeks; and then the time shall return, and the street shall be built, and the wall, and the times shall be exhausted.
And after the sixty-two weeks, the anointed one shall be destroyed, and there is no judgment in him: and he shall destroy the city and the sanctuary with the prince that is coming: they shall be cut off with a flood, and to the end of the war which is rapidly completed he shall appoint the city to desolations.
A wise judge will instruct his people; and the government of a prudent man is well ordered.
As the judge of the people is himself, so are his officers; and what manner of man the ruler of the city is, such are all they that dwell therein.
An unwise king destroyeth his people; but through the prudence of them which are in authority the city shall be inhabited.
The power of the earth is in the hand of the Lord, and in due time he will set over it one that is profitable.
In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.
Bear not hatred to thy neighbour for every wrong; and do nothing at all by injurious practices.
Pride is hateful before God and man: and by both doth one commit iniquity.
Because of unrighteous dealings, injuries, and riches got by deceit, the kingdom is translated from one people to another.
Why is earth and ashes proud? There is not a more wicked thing than a covetous man: for such an one setteth his own soul to sale; because while he liveth he casteth away his bowels.
The physician cutteth off a long disease; and he that is to day a king to morrow shall die.
For when a man is dead, he shall inherit creeping things, beasts, and worms.
The beginning of pride is when one departeth from God, and his heart is turned away from his Maker.
For pride is the beginning of sin, and he that hath it shall pour out abomination: and therefore the Lord brought upon them strange calamities, and overthrew them utterly.
The Lord hath cast down the thrones of proud princes, and set up the meek in their stead.
The Lord hath plucked up the roots of the proud nations, and planted the lowly in their place.
The Lord overthrew countries of the heathen, and destroyed them to the foundations of the earth.
He took some of them away, and destroyed them, and hath made their memorial to cease from the earth.
Pride was not made for men, nor furious anger for them that are born of a woman.
They that fear the Lord are a sure seed, and they that love him an honourable plant: they that regard not the law are a dishonourable seed; they that transgress the commandments are a deceivable seed.
Among brethren he that is chief is honourably; so are they that fear the Lord in his eyes.
Whether he be rich, noble, or poor, their glory is the fear of the Lord.
It is not meet to despise the poor man that hath understanding; neither is it convenient to magnify a sinful man.
Great men, and judges, and potentates, shall be honoured; yet is there none of them greater than he that feareth the Lord.
Unto the servant that is wise shall they that are free do service: and he that hath knowledge will not grudge when he is reformed.
Be not overwise in doing thy business; and boast not thyself in the time of thy distress.
Better is he that laboureth, and aboundeth in all things, than he that boasteth himself, and wanteth bread.
My son, glorify thy soul in meekness, and give it honour according to the dignity thereof.
Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?
He that is honoured in poverty, how much more in riches? and he that is dishonourable in riches, how much more in poverty?
Strengthen yourselves, ye children of Benjamin, to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and sound an alarm with the trumpet in Thecue, and set up a signal over Baethacharma: for evil threatens from the north, and a great destruction is coming.
And thy pride, O daughter of Sion, shall be taken away.
And I allowed my wrath to come to full, yet I kept it in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days.
Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evils upon this people, even the fruit of their rebellions; for they have not heeded my words, and they have rejected my law.
Wherefore do ye bring me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a land afar off? your whole-burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices have not been pleasant to me.
Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will bring weakness upon this people, and the fathers and sons shall be weak together; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.
Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people comes from the north, and nations shall be stirred up from the end of the earth.
They shall lay hold on bow and spear; the people is fierce, and will have no mercy; their voice is as the roaring sea; they shall array themselves for war against thee as fire on horses and chariots, O daughter of Sion.
O daughter of my people, gird thyself with sackcloth: sprinkle thyself with ashes; make for thyself pitiable lamentation, as the mourning for a beloved son: for misery will come suddenly upon you.
Call ye them reprobate silver, because the Lord has rejected them.
And it came to pass, after Israel was taken captive, and Jerusalem made desolate, that Jeremias sat weeping, and lamented with this lamentation over Jerusalem, and said, ALEPH. How does the city that was filled with people sit solitary! she is become as a widow: she that was magnified among the nations, and princess among the provinces, has become tributary.
BETH. She weeps sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks; and there is none of all her lovers to comfort her: all that were her friends have dealt deceitfully with her, they are become her enemies.
GIMEL. Judea is gone into captivity by reason of her affliction, and by reason of the abundance of her servitude: she dwells among the nations, she has not found rest: all her pursuers have overtaken her between her oppressors.
DALETH. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the feast: all her gates are ruined: her priests groan, her virgins are led captive, and she is in bitterness in herself.
HE. Her oppressors are become the head, and her enemies have prospered; for the Lord has afflicted her because of the multitude of her sins: her young children are gone into captivity before the face of the oppressor.
VAU. And all her beauty has been taken away from the daughter of Sion: her princes were as rams finding no pasture, and are gone away in weakness before the face of the pursuer.
ZAIN. Jerusalem remembered the days of her affliction, and her rejection; she thought on all her desirable things which were from the days of old, when her people fell into the hands of the oppressor, and there was none to help her: when her enemies saw it they laughed at her habitation.
HETH. Jerusalem has sinned a great sin; therefore has she come into tribulation, all that used to honour her have afflicted her, for they have seen her shame: yea, she herself groaned, and turned backward.
TETH. Her uncleanness is before her feet; she remembered not her last end; she has lowered her boasting tone, there is none to comfort her. Behold, O Lord, my affliction: for the enemy has magnified himself.
JOD. The oppressor has stretched out his hand on all her desirable things: for she has seen the Gentiles entering into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation.
CHAPH. All her people groan, seeking bread: they have given their desirable things for meat, to restore their soul: behold, Lord, and look; for she is become dishonoured.
LAMED. All ye that pass by the way, turn, and see if there is sorrow like to my sorrow, which has happened to me. The Lord who spoke by me has afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
MEM. He has sent fire from his lofty habitation, he has brought it into my bones: he has spread a net for my feet, he has turned me back: he has made me desolate and mourning all the day.
NUN. He has watched over my sins, they are twined about my hands, they have come up on my neck: my strength has failed; for the Lord has laid pains on my hands, I shall not be able to stand.
SAMECH. The Lord has cut off all my strong men from the midst of me: he has summoned against me a time for crushing my choice men: the Lord has trodden a wine-press for the virgin daughter of Juda: for these things I weep.
AIN. Mine eye has poured out water, because he that should comfort me, that should restore my soul, has been removed far from me: my sons have been destroyed, because the enemy has prevailed.
PHE. Sion has spread out her hand, and there is none to comfort her: the Lord has commanded concerning Jacob, his oppressors are round about him: Jerusalem has become among them as a removed woman.
KOPH. I called my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders failed in the city; for they sought meat that they might restore their souls, and found it not.
RHECHS. Behold, O Lord; for I am afflicted: my belly is troubled, and my heart is turned within me; for I have been grievously rebellious: abroad the sword has bereaved me, even as death at home.
CHSEN. Hear, I pray you, for I groan: there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard of mine afflictions, and rejoice because thou hast done it: thou hast brought on the day, thou hast called the time: they are become like to me.
THAU. Let all their wickedness come before thy face; and strip them, as they have made a gleaning for all my sins: for my groans are many, and my heart is grieved.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Whatsoever woman shall have conceived and born a male child shall be unclean seven days, she shall be unclean according to the days of separation for her monthly courses.
And on the eighth day she shall circumcise the flesh of his foreskin.
And for thirty-three days she shall continue in her unclean blood; she shall touch nothing holy, and shall not enter the sanctuary, until the days of her purification be fulfilled.
But if she should have born a female child, then she shall be unclean twice seven days, according to the time of her monthly courses; and for sixty-six days shall she remain in her unclean blood.
And when the days of her purification shall have been fulfilled for a son or a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of a year old without blemish for a whole-burnt-offering, and a young pigeon or turtle-dove for a sin-offering to the door of the tabernacle of witness, to the priest.
And he shall present it before the Lord, and the priest shall make atonement for her, and shall purge her from the fountain of her blood; this is the law of her who bears a male or a female.
And if she cannot afford a lamb, then shall she take two turtle-doves or two young pigeons, one for a whole-burnt-offering, and one for a sin-offering; and the priest shall make atonement for her, and she shall be purified.
And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Joseph, Behold, thy father is ill; and, having taken his two sons, Manasse and Ephraim, he came to Jacob.
And it was reported to Jacob, saying, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh to thee; and Israel having strengthened himself, sat upon the bed.
And Jacob said to Joseph, My God appeared to me in Luza, in the land of Chanaan, and blessed me,
and said to me, Behold, I will increase thee, and multiply thee, and will make of thee multitudes of nations; and I will give this land to thee, and to thy seed after thee, for an everlasting possession.
Now then thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt, before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasse, as Ruben and Symeon they shall be mine.
And the children which thou shalt beget hereafter, shall be in the name of their brethren; they shall be named after their inheritances.
And as for me, when I came out of Mesopotamia of Syria, Rachel, thy mother, died in the land of Chanaan, as I drew night to the horse-course of Chabratha of the land , so as to come to Ephratha; and I buried her in the road of the course; this is Bethlehem.
And when Israel saw the sons of Joseph, he said, Who are these to thee?
And Joseph said to his father, They are my sons, whom God gave me here; and Jacob said, Bring me them, that I may bless them.
Now the eyes of Israel were dim through age, and he could not see; and he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.
And Israel said to Joseph, Behold, I have not been deprived of thy face, and lo! God has showed me thy seed also.
And Joseph brought them out from his knees, and they did reverence to him, with their face to the ground.
And Joseph took his two sons, both Ephraim in his right hand, but on the left of Israel, and Manasse on his left hand, but on the right of Israel, and brought them near to him.
But Israel having stretched out his right hand, laid it on the head of Ephraim, and he was the younger; and his left hand on the head of Manasse, his hands crosswise.
And he blessed them and said, The God in whose sight my fathers were well pleasing, Abraam and Isaac, the God who continues to feed me from my youth until this day;
the angel who delivers me from all evils, bless these boys, and my name shall be called upon them, and the name of my fathers, Abraam and Isaac; and let them be increased to a great multitude on the earth.
And Joseph having seen that his father put his right hand on the head of Ephraimit seemed grievous to him; and Joseph took hold of the hand of his father, to remove it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasse.
And Joseph said to his father, Not so, father; for this is the first-born; lay thy right-hand upon his head.
And he would not, but said, I know it, son, I know it; he also shall be a people, and he shall be exalted, but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.
And Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened to your voice in all things that ye have said to me, and I have set a king over you.
And now, behold, the king goes before you; and I am grown old and shall rest; and, behold, my sons are among you; and, behold, I have gone about before you from my youth to this day.
Behold, here am I, answer against me before the Lord and before his anointed: whose calf have I taken? or whose ass have I taken? or whom of you have I oppressed? or from whose hand have I taken a bribe, even to a sandal? bear witness against me, and I will make restitution to you.
And they said to Samuel, Thou hast not injured us, and thou hast not oppressed us; and thou hast not afflicted us, and thou hast not taken anything from any one's hand.
And Samuel said to the people, The Lord is witness among you, and his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found anything in my hand: and they said, He is witness.
And Samuel spoke to the people, saying, The Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron is witness, who brought our fathers up out of Egypt.
And now stand still, and I will judge you before the Lord; and I will relate to you all the righteousness of the Lord, the things which he has wrought among you and your fathers.
When Jacob and his sons went into Egypt, and Egypt humbled them, then our fathers cried to the Lord, and the Lord sent Moses and Aaron; and they brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he made them to dwell in this place.
And they forgot the Lord their God, and he sold them into the hands of Sisara captain of the host of Jabis king of Asor, and into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of the king of Moab; and he fought with them.
And they cried to the Lord, and said, We have sinned, for we have forsaken the Lord, and have served Baalim and the groves: and now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we will serve thee.
And he sent Jerobaal, and Barac, and Jephthae, and Samuel, and rescued us out of the hand of our enemies round about, and ye dwelt in security.
And ye saw that Naas king of the children of Ammon came against you, and ye said, Nay, none but a king shall reign over us; whereas the Lord our God is our king.
And now behold the king whom ye have chosen; and behold, the Lord has set a king over you.
If ye should fear the Lord, and serve him, and hearken to his voice, and not resist the mouth of the Lord, and ye and your king that reigns over you should follow the Lord, well.
But if ye should not hearken to the voice of the Lord, and ye should resist the mouth of the Lord, then shall the hand of the Lord be upon you and upon your king.
And now stand still, and see this great thing, which the Lord will do before your eyes.
Is it not wheat-harvest to-day? I will call upon the Lord, and he shall send thunder and rain; and know ye and see, that your wickedness is great which ye have wrought before the Lord, having asked for yourselves a king.
And Samuel called upon the Lord, and the Lord sent thunders and rain in that day; and all the people feared greatly the Lord and Samuel.
And all the people said to Samuel, Pray for thy servants to the Lord thy God, and let us not die; for we have added to all our sins this iniquity, in asking for us a king.
And Samuel said to the people, Fear not: ye have indeed wrought all this iniquity; only turn not from following the Lord, and serve the Lord with all your heart.
And turn not aside after the gods that are nothing, who will do nothing, and will not deliver you, because they are nothing.
For the Lord will not cast off his people for his great name's sake, because the Lord graciously took you to himself for a people.
And far be it from me to sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you: but I will serve the Lord, and shew you the good and the right way.
Only fear the Lord, and serve him in truth and with all your heart, for ye see what great things he has wrought with you.
But if ye continue to do evil, then shall ye and your king be consumed.
Weary in my soul, I will pour my words with groans upon him: I will speak being straitened in the bitterness of my soul.
And I will say to the Lord, Do not teach me to be impious; and wherefore hast thou thus judged me?
Is it good before thee if I be unrighteous? for thou hast disowned the work of thy hands, and attended to the counsel of the ungodly.
Or dost thou see as a mortal sees? or wilt thou look as a man sees?
Or is thy life human, or thy years the years of a man,
that thou hast enquired into mine iniquity, and searched out my sins?
For thou knowest that I have not committed iniquity: but who is he that can deliver out of thy hands?
Thy hands have formed me and made me; afterwards thou didst change thy mind, and smite me.
Remember that thou hast made me as clay, and thou dost turn me again to earth.
Hast thou not poured me out like milk, and curdled me like cheese?
And thou didst clothe me with skin and flesh, and frame me with bones and sinews.
And thou didst bestow upon me life and mercy, and thy oversight has preserved my spirit.
Having these things in thyself, I know that thou canst do all things; for nothing is impossible with thee.
And if I should sin, thou watchest me; and thou hast not cleared me from iniquity.
Or if I should be ungodly, woe is me: and if I should be righteous, I cannot lift myself up, for I am full of dishonour.
For I am hunted like a lion for slaughter; for again thou hast changed and art terribly destroying me;
renewing against me my torture: and thou hast dealt with me in great anger, and thou hast brought trials upon me.
Why then didst thou bring me out of the womb? and why did I not die, and no eye see me,
and I become as if I had not been? for why was I not carried from the womb to the grave?
Is not the time of my life short? suffer me to rest a little,
before I go whence I shall not return, to a land of darkness and gloominess;
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Do thou also charge the children of Israel, saying, Take heed and keep my sabbaths; for they are a sign with me and among you throughout your generations, that ye may know that I am the Lord that sanctifies you.
And ye shall keep the sabbaths, because this is holy to the Lord for you; he that profanes it shall surely be put to death: every one who shall do a work on it, that soul shall be destroyed from the midst of his people.
Six days thou shalt do works, but the seventh day is the sabbath, a holy rest to the Lord; every one who shall do a work on the seventh day shall be put to death.
And the children of Israel shall keep the sabbaths, to observe them throughout their generations.
It is a perpetual covenant with me and the children of Israel, it is a perpetual sign with me; for in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and on the seventh day he ceased, and rested.
And he gave to Moses when he left off speaking to him in mount Sina the two tables of testimony, tables of stone written upon with the finger of God.
I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.
The Lord is my firm support, and my refuge, and my deliverer; my God is my helper, I will hope in him; he is my defender, and the horn of my salvation, and my helper.
I will call upon the Lord with praises, and I shall be saved from mine enemies.
The pangs of death compassed me, and the torrents of ungodliness troubled me exceedingly.
The pangs of hell came round about me: the snares of death prevented me.
And when I was afflicted I called upon the Lord, and cried to my God: he heard my voice out of this holy temple, and my cry shall enter before him, even into his ears.
Then the earth shook and quaked, and the foundations of the mountains were disturbed, and were shaken, because God was angry with them.
There went up a smoke in his wrath, and fire burst into a flame at his presence: coals were kindled at it.
And he bowed the heaven, and came down: and thick darkness was under his feet.
And he mounted on cherubs and flew: he flew on the wings of winds.
And he made darkness his secret place: round about him was his tabernacle, even dark water in the clouds of the air.
At the brightness before him the clouds passed, hail and coals of fire.
The Lord also thundered from heaven, and the Highest uttered his voice.
And he sent forth his weapons, and scattered them; and multiplied lightnings, and routed them.
And the springs of waters appeared, and the foundations of the world were exposed, at thy rebuke, O Lord, at the blasting of the breath of thy wrath.
He sent from on high and took me, he drew me to himself out of many waters.
He will deliver me from my mighty enemies, and from them that hate me; for they are stronger than I.
They prevented me in the day of mine affliction: but the Lord was my stay against them.
And he brought me out into a wide place: he will deliver me, because he has pleasure in me.
And the Lord will recompense me according to my righteousness; even according to the purity of my hands will he recompense me.
For I have kept the way of the Lord and have not wickedly departed from my God.
For all his judgments were before me, and his ordinances departed not from me.
And I shall be blameless with hem, and shall keep myself from mine iniquity.
And the Lord shall recompense me according to my righteousness, and according to the purity of my hands before his eyes.
With the holy thou wilt be holy; and with the innocent man thou wilt be innocent.
And with the excellent man thou wilt be excellent; and with the perverse thou wilt shew frowardness.
For thou wilt save the lowly people, and wilt humble the eyes of the proud.
For thou, O Lord, wilt light my lamp: my God, thou wilt lighten my darkness.
For by thee shall I be delivered from a troop; and by my God I will pass over a wall.
As for my God, his way is perfect: the oracles of the Lord are tried in the fire; he is a protector of all them that hope in him.
For who is God but the Lord? and who is a God except our God?
It is God that girds me with strength, and has made my way blameless:
who strengthens my feet as hart's feet, and sets me upon high places.
He instructs my hands for war: and thou hast made my arms as a brazen bow.
And thou hast made me secure in my salvation: and thy right hand has helped me, and thy correction has upheld me to the end; yea, thy correction itself shall instruct me.
Thou has made room for my goings under me, and by footsteps did not fail.
I will pursue mine enemies, and overtake them; and I will not turn back until they are consumed.
I will dash them to pieces and they shall not be able to stand: they shall fall under my feet.
For thou hast girded me with strength for war: thou hast beaten down under me all that rose up against me.
And thou has made mine enemies turn their backs before me; and thou hast destroyed them that hated me.
They cried, but there was no deliverer: even to the Lord, but he hearkened not to them.
I will grind them as the mud of the streets: and I will beat them small as dust before the wind.
Deliver me from the gain sayings of the people: thou shalt make me head of the Gentiles: a people whom I knew not served me,
at the hearing of the ear they obeyed me: the strange children lied to me.
The strange children waxed old, and fell away from their paths through lameness.
The Lord lives; and blessed be my God; and let the God of my salvation be exalted.
It is God that avenges me, and has subdued the nations under me;
my deliverer from angry enemies: thou shalt set me on high above them that rise up against me: thou shalt deliver me from the unrighteous man.
Therefore will I confess to thee, O Lord, among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.
God magnifies the deliverances of his king; and deals mercifully with David his anointed, and his seed, for ever.
And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and beheld, and lo! Esau his brother coming, and four hundred men with him; and Jacob divided the children to Lea and to Rachel, and the two handmaidens.
And he put the two handmaidens and their children with the first, and Lea and her children behind, and Rachel and Joseph last.
And Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, What are these to thee? And he said, The children with which God has mercifully blessed thy servant.
And the maid-servants and their children drew near and did reverence.
And Lea and her children drew near and did reverence; and after this drew near Rachel and Joseph, and did reverence.
Blessed is the man who thinks, on the poor and needy: the Lord shall deliver him in an evil day.
May the Lord preserve him and keep him alive, and bless him on the earth, and not deliver him into the hands of his enemy.
May the Lord help him upon the bed of his pain; thou hast made all his bed in his sickness.
I said, O Lord, have mercy upon me; heal my soul; for I have sinned against thee.
Mine enemies have spoken evil against me, saying, When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he came to see me, his heart spoke vainly; he gathered iniquity to himself; he went forth and spoke in like manner.
All my enemies whispered against me; against me they devised my hurt.
They denounced a wicked word against me, saying, Now that he lies, shall he not rise up again?
For even the man of my peace, in whom I trusted, who ate my bread, lifted up his heel against me.
But thou, O Lord, have compassion upon me, and raise me up, and I shall requite them.
By this I know that thou hast delighted in me, because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me.
But thou didst help me because of mine innocence, and hast established me before thee for ever.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. So be it, so be it.
Woe to the apostate children, saith the Lord: ye have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit, to add sins to sins:
even they that proceed to go down into Egypt, but they have not enquired of me, that they might be helped by Pharao, and protected by the Egyptians.
For the protection of Pharaoh shall be to you a disgrace, and there shall be a reproach to them that trust in Egypt.
For there are princes in Tanes, evil messengers.
In vain shall they labour in seeking to a people, which shall not profit them for help, but shall be for a shame and reproach.
THE VISION OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE DESERT. In affliction and distress, where are the lion and lion's whelp, thence come also asps, and the young of flying asps, there shall they be who bore their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which shall not profit them.
The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.
Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for many long days, and even for ever.
For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God:
who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak them not to us, but speak and report to us another error;
and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel.
Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this respect:
therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand.
And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel, as small fragments of a pitcher, so that thou shouldest not find among them a sherd, with which thou mightest take up fire, and with which thou shouldest draw a little water.
Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities: then your strength became vain, yet ye would not hearken:
but ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.
A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.
And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay themselves upon him.
For the holy people shall dwell in Sion: and whereas Jerusalem has wept bitterly, saying, Pity me; he shall pity thee: when he perceived the voice of thy cry, he hearkened to thee.
And though the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that cause thee to err shall no more at all draw nigh to thee; for thine eyes shall see those that cause thee to err,
and thine ears shall hear the words of them that went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This is the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left.
And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou shalt grind to powder the gilt ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a removed woman, and thou shalt thrust them forth as dung.
Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land; and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place.
Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley.
And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall.
And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound.
Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a long time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire.
And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for their vain error: error also shall pursue them, and overtake them.
Must ye always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel?
And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and his wrath shall be as water and violent hail.
For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, even by the stroke wherewith he shall smite them.
And it shall happen to him from every side, that they from whom their hope of assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn with drums and with harp.
For thou shalt be required before thy time: has it been prepared for thee also to reign? nay, God has prepared for thee a deep trench, wood piled, fire and much wood: the wrath of the Lord shall be as a trench kindled with sulphur.
Give thanks to the Lord; for he is good: for his mercy endures for ever.
Who shall tell the mighty acts of the Lord? who shall cause all his praises to be heard?
Blessed are they that keep judgment, and do righteousness at all times.
Remember us, O Lord, with the favour thou hast to thy people: visit us with thy salvation;
that we may behold the good of thine elect, that we may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, that we may glory with thine inheritance.
We have sinned with our fathers, we have transgressed, we have done unrighteously.
Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders, and remembered not the multitude of thy mercy; but provoked him as they went up by the Red Sea.
Yet he saved them for his name's sake, that he might cause his mighty power to be known.
And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up: so he led them through the deep as through the wilderness.
And he saved them out of the hand of them that hated them, and redeemed them out of the hand of the enemy.
The water covered those that oppressed them: there was not one of them left.
Then they believed his words, and celebrated his praise.
They made haste, they forgot his works; they waited not for his counsel.
And they lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in the dry land.
And he gave them their request, and sent fullness into their souls.
They provoked Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the holy one of the Lord.
The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and closed upon the congregation of Abiron.
And a fire was kindled in their congregation, and a flame burnt up the sinners.
And they made a calf in Choreb, and worshipped the graven image,
and they changed their glory into the similitude of a calf that feeds on grass.
They forgot God that saved them, who had wrought great deeds in Egypt;
wondrous works in the land of Cham, and terrible things at the Red Sea.
So he said that he would have destroyed them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn him away from the fierceness of his anger, so that he should not destroy them.
Moreover they set at nought the desirable land, and believed not his word.
And they murmured in their tents: they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord.
So he lifted up his hand against them, to cast them down in the wilderness;
and to cast down their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the countries.
They were joined also to Beelphegor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead. And they provoked him with their devices;
and destruction, was multiplied among them.
Then Phinees stood up, and made atonement: and the plague ceased.
And it was counted to him for righteousness, to all generations for ever.
They provoked him also at the water of Strife, and Moses was hurt for their sakes;
for they provoked his spirit, and he spoke unadvisedly with his lips.
They destroyed not the nations which the Lord told them to destroy;
but were mingled with the heathen, and learned their works.
And they served their graven images; and it became an offence to them.
And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,
and shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan; and the land was defiled with blood.
and was polluted with their works; and they went a whoring with their own devices.
So the Lord was very angry with his people, and he abhorred his inheritance.
And he delivered them into the hands of their enemies; and they that hated them ruled over them.
Ands their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought down under their hands.
Many a time he delivered them; but they provoked him by their counsel, and they were brought low by their iniquities.
Ye the Lord looked upon their affliction, when he heard their petition.
And he remembered his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercy.
And he caused them to be pitied in the sight of all who carried them captive.
Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the heathen, that we may give thanks to thy holy name, that we may glory in thy praise.
Blessed be the Lord God of Israel from everlasting and to everlasting; and all the people shall say, Amen, Amen.
And when the people had completely passed over Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,
Take men from the people, one of each tribe,
and charge them; and ye shall take out of the midst of Jordan twelve fit stones, and having carried them across together with yourselves, place them in your camp, where ye shall encamp for the night.
And Joshua having called twelve men of distinction among the children of Israel, one of each tribe,
said to them, Advance before me in the presence of the Lord into the midst of Jordan, and each having taken up a stone from thence, let him carry it on his shoulders, according to the number of the twelve tribes of Israel:
that these may be to you continually for an appointed sign, that when thy son asks thee in future, saying, What are these stones to us?
then thou mayest explain to thy son, saying, The river Jordan was dried up from before the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth, when it passed it: and these stones shall be for a memorial for you for the children of Israel for ever.
And the children of Israel did so, as the Lord commanded Joshua; and they took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, (as the Lord commanded Joshua, when the children of Israel had completely passed over,) and carried these stones with them into the camp, and laid them down there.
And Joshua set also other twelve stones in Jordan itself, in the place that was under the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord; and there they are to this day.
And the priests that bore the ark of the covenant stood in Jordan, until Joshua had finished all that the Lord commanded him to report to the people; and the people hasted and passed over.
And it came to pass when all the people had passed over, that the ark of the covenant of the Lord passed over, and the stones before them.
And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse passed over armed before the children of Israel, as Moses commanded them.
Forty thousand armed for battle went over before the Lord to war, to the city of Jericho.
In that day the Lord magnified Joshua before all the people of Israel; and they feared him, as they did Moses, as long as he lived.
And the Lord spoke to Joshua, saying,
Charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the testimony of the Lord, to go up out of Jordan.
And Joshua charged the priests, saying, Go up out of Jordan.
And it came to pass when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were gone up out of Jordan, and set their feet upon the land, that the water of Jordan returned impetuously to its place, and went as before over all its banks.
And the people went up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month; and the children of Israel encamped in Galgala in the region eastward from Jericho.
And Joshua set these twelve stones which he took out of Jordan, in Galgala,
saying, When your sons ask you, saying, What are these stones?
Tell your sons, that Israel went over this Jordan on dry land,
when the Lord our God had dried up the water of Jordan from before them, until they had passed over; as the Lord our God did to the Red Sea, which the Lord our God dried up from before us, until we passed over.
That all the nations of the earth might know, that the power of the Lord is mighty, and that ye might worship the Lord our God in every work.
Have mercy, upon me, O God, have mercy upon me: for my soul has trusted in thee: and in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, until the iniquity have passed away.
I will cry to God most high; the God who has benefited me. Pause.
He sent from heaven and saved me; he gave to reproach them that trampled on me: God has sent forth his mercy and his truth;
and he has delivered my soul from the midst of lions'whelps: I lay down to sleep, though troubled. As for the sons of men, their teeth are arms and missile weapons, and their tongue a sharp sword.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
They have prepared snares for my feet, and have bowed down my soul: they have dug a pit before my face, and fallen into it themselves. Pause.
My heart, O God, is ready, my heart is ready: I will sing, yea will sing psalms.
Awake, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I will awake early.
O Lord, I will give thanks to thee among the nations: I will sing to thee among the Gentiles.
For thy mercy has been magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth to the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; and thy glory above all the earth.
At the going forth of Israel from Egypt, of the house of Jacob from a barbarous people,
Judea became his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
The sea saw and fled: Jordan was turned back.
The mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs.
What ailed thee, O sea, that thou fleddest? and thou Jordan, that thou wast turned back?
Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams, and ye hills, like lambs?
The earth trembled at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob;
who turned the rock into pools of water, and the flint into fountains of water.
In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judea; Behold a strong city; and he shall make salvation its wall and bulwark.
Open ye the gates, let the nation enter that keeps righteousness, and keeps truth,
supporting truth, and keeping peace: for on thee, O Lord,
they have trusted with confidence for ever, the great, the eternal God;
who hast humbled and brought down them that dwell on high, thou shalt cast down strong cities, and bring them to the ground.
And the feet of the meek and lowly shall trample them.
The way of the godly is made straight: the way of the godly is also prepared.
For the way of the Lord is judgment: we have hoped in thy name, and on the remembrance of thee,
which our soul longs for: my spirit seeks thee very early in the morning, O God, for thy commandments are a light on the earth: learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth.
For the ungodly one is put down: no one who will not learn righteousness on the earth, shall be able to do the truth: let the ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.
O Lord, thine arm is exalted, yet they knew it not: but when they know they shall be ashamed: jealousy shall seize upon an untaught nation, and now fire shall devour the adversaries.
O Lord our God, give us peace: for thou hast rendered to us all things.
O Lord our God, take possession of us: O Lord, we know not any other beside thee: we name thy name.
But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians by any means raise them up: therefore thou hast brought wrath upon them, and slain them, and hast taken away every male of them. Bring more evils upon them, O Lord;
bring more evils on the glorious ones of the earth.
Lord, in affliction I remembered thee; thy chastening was to us with small affliction.
And as a woman in travail draws nigh to be delivered, and cries out in her pain; so have we been to thy beloved.
We have conceived, O Lord, because of thy fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of thy salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all that dwell upon the land shall fall.
The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew from thee is healing to them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish.
Go, my people, enter into thy closets, shut thy door, hide thyself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have passed away.
For, behold, the Lord is bringing wrath from his holy place upon the dwellers on the earth: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall not cover her slain.
And these are the kings of the land, whom the children of Israel slew, and inherited their land beyond Jordan from the east, from the valley of Arnon to the mount of Aermon, and all the land of Araba on the east.
Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon, ruling from Arnon, which is in the valley, on the side of the valley, and half of Galaad as far as Jaboc, the borders of the children of Ammon.
And Araba as far as the sea of Chenereth eastward, and as far as the sea of Araba; the salt sea eastward by the way to Asimoth, from Thaeman under Asedoth Phasga.
And Og king of Basan, who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain, was left of the giants
ruling from mount Aermon and from Secchai, and over all the land of Basan to the borders of Gergesi, and Machi, and the half of Galaad of the borders of Seon king of Esebon.
Moses the servant of the Lord and the children of Israel smote them; and Moses gave them by way of inheritance to Ruben, and Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasse.
And these are the kings of the Amorites, whom Joshua and the children of Israel slew beyond Jordan by the sea of Balagad in the plain of Libanus, and as far as the mountain of Chelcha, as men go up to Seir: and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel to inherit according to their portion;
in the mountain, and in the plain, and in Araba, and in Asedoth, and in the wilderness, and Nageb; the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite.
The king of Jericho, and the king of Gai, which is near Baethel;
the king of Jerusalem, the king of Chebron,
the king of Jerimuth, the king of Lachis;
the king of Aelam, the king of Gazer;
the king of Dabir, the king of Gader:
the king of Hermath, the king of Ader;
the king of Lebna, the king of Odollam,
the king of Elath,
the king of Taphut, the king of Opher,
the king of Ophec of Aroc,
the king of Asom,
the king of Symoon, the king of Mambroth, the king of Aziph,
the king of Cades, the king of Zachac,
the king of Maredoth, the king of Jecom of Chermel,
the king of Odollam belonging to Phennealdor, the king of Gei of Galilee:
the king of Thersa: all these were twenty-nine kings.
The Song of songs, which is Solomon's.
Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy breasts are better than wine.
And the smell of thine ointments is better than all spices: thy name is ointment poured forth; therefore do the young maidens love thee.
They have drawn thee: we will run after thee, for the smell of thine ointments: the king has brought me into closet: let us rejoice and be glad in thee; we will love thy breasts more than wine: righteousness loves thee.
I am black, but beautiful, ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.
Look not upon me, because I am dark, because the sun has looked unfavourably upon me: my mother's sons strove with me; they made me keeper in the vineyards; I have not kept my own vineyard.
Tell me, thou whom my soul loves, where thou tendest thy flock, where thou causest them to rest at noon, lest I become as one that is veiled by the flocks of thy companions.
If thou know not thyself, thou fair one among women, go thou forth by the footsteps of the flocks, and feed thy kids by the shepherd's tents.
I have likened thee, my companion, to my horses in the chariots of Pharao.
How are thy cheeks beautiful as those of a dove, thy neck as chains!
We will make thee figures of gold with studs of silver.
So long as the king was at table, my spikenard gave forth its smell.
My kinsman is to me a bundle of myrrh; he shall lie between my breasts.
My kinsman is to me a cluster of camphor in the vineyards of Engaddi.
Behold, thou art fair, my companion; behold, thou art fair; thine eyes are doves.
Behold, thou art fair, my kinsman, yea, beautiful, overshadowing our bed.
The beams of our house are cedars, our ceilings are of cypress.
Blessed is the man who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly, and has not stood in the way of sinners, and has not sat in the seat of evil men.
But his pleasure is in the law of the Lord; and in his law will he meditate day and night.
And he shall be as a tree planted by the brooks of waters, which shall yield its fruit in its season, and its leaf shall not fall off; and whatsoever he shall do shall be prospered.
Not so the ungodly; not so: but rather as the chaff which the wind scatters away from the face of the earth.
Therefore the ungodly shall not rise in judgment, nor sinners in the counsel of the just.
For the Lord knows the way of the righteous; but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
in the tabernacle of the testimony, without the veil that is before the ark of the covenant, shall Aaron and his sons burn it from evening until morning, before the Lord: it is a perpetual ordinance throughout your generations of the children of Israel.
But Job answered and said,
Oh that one would indeed weigh the wrath that is upon me, and take up my griefs in a balance together!
And verily they would be heavier than the sand by the seashore: but, as it seems, my words are vain.
For the arrows of the Lord are in my body, whose violence drinks up my blood: whenever I am going to speak, they pierce me.
What then? will the wild ass bray for nothing, if he is not seeking food? or again, will the ox low at the manger, when he has a fodder?
Shall bread be eaten without salt? or again, is there taste in empty words?
For my wrath cannot cease; for I perceive my food as the smell of a lion to be loathsome.
For oh that he would grant my desire, and my petition might come, and the Lord would grant my hope!
Let the grave be my city, upon the walls of which I have leaped: I will not shrink from it; for I have not denied the holy words of my God.
For what is my strength, that I continue? what is my time, that my soul endures?
Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of brass?
Or have I not trusted in him? but help is far from me.
Mercy has rejected me; and the visitation of the Lord has disregarded me.
My nearest relations have not regarded me; they have passed me by like a failing brook, or like a wave.
They who used to reverence me, now have come against me like snow or congealed ice.
When it has melted at the approach of heat, it is not known what it was.
Thus I also have been deserted of all; and I am ruined, and become an outcast.
Behold the ways of the Thaemanites, ye that mark the paths of the Sabaeans.
They too that trust in cities and riches shall come to shame.
But ye also have come to me without pity; so that beholding my wound ye are afraid.
What? have I made any demand of you? or do I ask for strength from you,
to deliver me from enemies, or to rescue me from the hand of the mighty ones?
Teach ye me, and I will be silent: if in anything I have erred, tell me.
But as it seems, the words of a true man are vain, because I do not ask strength of you.
Neither will your reproof cause me to cease my words, for neither will I endure the sound of your speech.
Even because ye attack the fatherless, and insult your friend.
But now, having looked upon your countenances, I will not lie.
Sit down now, and let there not be unrighteousness; and unite again with the just.
For there is no injustice in my tongue; and does not my throat meditate understanding?
And it came to pass in those days that the Philistines gathered themselves together against Israel to war; and Israel went out to meet them and encamped at Abenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphec.
And the Philistines prepare to fight with Israel, and the battle was turned against them; and the men of Israel fell before the Philistines, and there were smitten in the battle in the field four thousand men.
And the people came to the camp, and the elders of Israel said, Why has the Lord caused us to fall this day before the Philistines? let us take the ark of our God out of Selom, and let it proceed from the midst of us, and it shall save us from the hand of our enemies.
And the people sent to Selom, and they take thence the ark of the Lord who dwells between the cherubs: and both the sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, were with the ark.
And it came to pass when the ark of the Lord entered into the camp, that all Israel cried out with a loud voice, and the earth resounded.
And the Philistines heard the cry, and the Philistines said, What is this great cry in the camp of the Hebrews: and they understood that the ark of the Lord was come into the camp.
And the Philistines feared, and said, These are the Gods that are come to them into the camp.
Woe to us, O Lord, deliver us to-day for such a thing has not happened aforetime: woe to us, who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote Egypt with every plague, and in the wilderness.
Strengthen yourselves and behave yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye may not serve the Hebrews as they have served us, but be ye men and fight with them.
And they fought with them; and the men of Israel fall, and they fled every man to his ten; and there was a very great slaughter; and there fell of Israel thirty thousand fighting men.
And the ark of God was taken, and both the sons of Heli, Ophni, and Phinees, died.
And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the battle, and he came to Selom on that day: and his clothes were rent, and earth was upon his head.
And he came, an behold, Heli was upon the seat by the gate looking along the way, for his heart was greatly alarmed for the ark of God: and the man entered into the city to bring tidings; and the city cried out.
And Heli heard the sound of the cry, and said, What is the voice of this cry? and the men hasted and went in, and reported to Heli.
Now Heli was ninety years old, and his eyes were fixed, and he saw not.
And Heli said to them that stood round about him, What is the voice of this sound? And the man hasted and advanced to Heli, and said to him, I am he that is come out of the camp, and I have fled from the battle to-day: and Heli said, What is the even, my son?
And they young man answered and said, The men of Israel fled from the face of the Philistines, and there was a great slaughter among the people, and both thy sons are dead, and the ark of God is taken.
And it came to pass, when he mentioned the ark of God, that he fell from the seat backward near the gate, and his back was broken, and he died, for he was an old man and heavy: and he judged Israel twenty years.
And his daughter-in-law the wife of Phinees was with child, about to bring forth; and she heard the tidings, that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead; and she wept and was delivered, for her pains came upon her.
And in her time she was at the point of death; and the women that stood by her, said to her, Fear not, for thou hast born a son: but she answered not, and her heart did not regard it.
And she called the child Uaebarchaboth, because of the ark of God, and because of her father-in-law, and because of her husband.
And they said, The glory of Israel is departed, forasmuch as the ark of the Lord is taken.
I will exalt thee, my God, my king; and I will bless thy name for ever and ever.
Every day will I bless thee, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever.
The Lord is great, and greatly to be praised; and there is no end to his greatness.
Generation after generation shall praise thy works, and tell of thy power.
And they shall speak of the glorious majesty of thy holiness, and recount thy wonders.
And they shall speak of the power of thy terrible acts; and recount thy greatness.
They shall utter the memory of the abundance of thy goodness, and shall exult in thy righteousness.
The Lord is compassionate, and merciful; long suffering, and abundant in mercy.
The Lord is good to those that wait on him; and his compassions are over all his works.
Let all thy works, O Lord, give thanks to thee; and let thy saints bless thee.
They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy dominion;
to make known to the sons of men thy power, and the glorious majesty of thy kingdom.
Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion endures through all generations. The Lord is faithful in his words, and holy in all his works.
The Lord supports all that are falling, and sets up all that are broken down.
The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their food in due season.
Thou openest thine hands, and fillest every living thing with pleasure.
The Lord is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works.
The Lord is near to all that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth.
He will perform the desire of them that fear him: and he will hear their supplication, and save them.
The Lord preserves all that love him: but all sinners he will utterly destroy.
My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.
And these the generations of Isaac the son of Abraam.
Abraam begot Isaac. And Isaac was forty years old when he took to wife Rebecca, daughter of Bathuel the Syrian, out of Syrian Mesopotamia, sister of Laban the Syrian.
And Isaac prayed the Lord concerning Rebecca his wife, because she was barren; and the Lord heard him, and his wife Rebecca conceived in her womb.
And Esau said to Jacob, Let me taste of that red pottage, because I am fainting; therefore his name was called Edom.
And Jacob said to Esau, Sell me this day thy birthright.
And Esau said, Behold, I am going to die, and for what good does this birthright to me?
And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Chanaan, and said to them, Go up by this wilderness; and ye shall go up to the mountain,
and ye shall see the land, what it is, and the people that dwells on it, whether it is strong or weak, or whether they are few or many.
And what the land is on which they dwell, whether it is good or bad; and what the cities are wherein these dwell, whether they dwell in walled cities or unwalled.
And what the land is, whether rich or poor; whether there are trees in it or no: and ye shall persevere and take of the fruits of the land: and the days were the days of spring, the forerunners of the grape.
And they went up and surveyed the land from the wilderness of Sin to Rhoob, as men go in to Aemath.
And they went up by the wilderness, and departed as far as Chebron; and there was Achiman, and Sessi, and Thelami, the progeny of Enach. Now Chebron was built seven years before Tanin of Egypt.
And they came to the valley of the cluster and surveyed it; and they cut down thence a bough and one cluster of grapes upon it, and bore it on staves, and they took of the pomegranates and the figs.
And they called that place, The valley of the cluster, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from thence.
And they returned from thence, having surveyed the land, after forty days.
And they proceeded and came to Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Pharan Cades; and they brought word to them and to all the congregation, and they shewed the fruit of the land:
and they reported to him, and said, We came into the land into which thou sentest us, a land flowing with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it.
Only the nation that dwells upon it is bold, and they have very great and strong walled towns, and we saw there the children of Enach.
And Amalec dwells in the land toward the south: and the Chettite and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite dwells in the hill country: and the Chananite dwells by the sea, and by the river Jordan.
And Chaleb stayed the people from speaking before Moses, and said to him, Nay, but we will go up by all means, and will inherit it, for we shall surely prevail against them.
But the men that went up together with him said, We will not go up, for we shall not by any means be able to go up against the nation, for it is much stronger than we.
And it came to pass when the time o the year for kings going out to battle had come round, that David sent Joab, and his servants with him, and all Israel; and they destroyed the children of Ammon, and besieged Rabbath: but David remained at Jerusalem.
And it came to pass toward evening, that David arose off his couch, and walked on the roof of the king's house, and saw from the roof a woman bathing; and the woman was very beautiful to look upon.
And David sent and enquired about the woman: and one said, Is not this Bersabee the daughter of Eliab, the wife of Urias the Chettite?
And David sent messengers, and took her, and went in to her, and he lay with her: and she was purified from her uncleanness, and returned to her house.
And the woman conceived; and she sent and told David, and said, I am with child.
And David sent to Joab, saying, Send me Urias the Chettite; and Joab sent Urias to David.
And Urias arrived and went in to him, and David asked him how Joab was, and how the people were, and how the war went on.
And David said to Urias, Go to thy house, and wash thy feet: and Urias departed from the house of the king, and a portion of meat from the king followed him.
And Urias slept at the door of the king with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
And they brought David word, saying, Urias has not gone down to his house. And David said to Urias, Art thou not come from a journey? why hast thou not gone down to thy house?
And Urias said to David, The ark, and Israel, and Juda dwell in tents; and my lord Joab, and the servants of my lord, are encamped in the open fields; and shall I go into my house to eat and drink, and lie with my wife? how should I do this? as thy soul lives, I will not do this thing.
And David said to Urias, Remain here to-day also, and to-morrow I will let thee go. So Urias remained in Jerusalem that day and the day following.
And David called him, and he ate before him and drank, and he made him drunk: and he went out in the evening to lie upon his bed with the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.
And the morning came, and David wrote a letter to Joab, and sent it by the hand of Urias.
And he wrote in the letter, saying, Station Urias in front of the severe part of the fight, and retreat from behind him, so shall he be wounded and die.
And it came to pass while Joab was watching against the city, that he set Urias in a place where he knew that valiant men were.
And the men of the city went out, and fought with Joab: and some of the people of the servants of David fell, and Urias the Chettite died also.
And Joab sent, and reported to David all the events of the war, so as to tell them to the king.
And he charged the messenger, saying, When thou hast finished reporting all the events of the war to the king,
then it shall come to pass if the anger of the king shall arise, and he shall say to thee, Why did ye draw nigh to the city to fight? knew ye not that they would shoot from off the wall?
Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal son of Ner? did not a woman cast a piece of a millstone upon him from above the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall? then thou shalt say, Thy servant Urias the Chettite is also dead.
And the messenger of Joab went to the king to Jerusalem, and he came and reported to David all that Joab told him, all the affairs of the war. And David was very angry with Joab, and said to the messenger, Why did ye draw nigh to the wall to fight? knew ye not that ye would be wounded from off the wall? Who smote Abimelech the son of Jerobaal? did not a woman cast upon him a piece of millstone from the wall, and he died in Thamasi? why did ye draw near to the wall?
And the messenger said to David, The men prevailed against us, and they came out against us into the field, and we came upon them even to the door of the gate.
And the archers shot at thy servants from off the wall, and some of the king's servants died, and thy servant Urias the Chettite is dead also.
And David said to the messenger, Thus shalt thou say to Joab, Let not the matter be grievous in thine eyes, for the sword devours one way at one time and another way at another: strengthen thine array against the city, and destroy it, and strengthen him.
And the wife of Urias heard that Urias her husband was dead, and she mourned for her husband.
And the time of mourning expired, and David sent and took her into his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son: but the thing which David did was evil in the eyes of the Lord.
And it came to pass after a time, in the days of wheat harvest, that Sampson visited his wife with a kid, and said, I will go in to my wife even into the chamber: but her father did not suffer him to go in.
And her father spoke, saying, I said that thou didst surely hate her, and I gave her to one of thy friends: is not her younger sister better than she? let her be to thee instead of her.
And Sampson said to them, Even for once am I guiltless with regard to the Philistines, in that I do mischief among them.
And Sampson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches, and turned tail to tail, and put a torch between two tails, and fastened it.
And he set fire to the torches, and sent the foxes into the corn of the Philistines; and every thing was burnt from the threshing floor to the standing corn, and even to the vineyard and olives.
And the Philistines said, Who has done these things? and they said, Sampson the son-in-law of the Thamnite, because he has taken his wife, and given her to one of his friends; and the Philistines went up, and burnt her and her father's house with fire.
And Sampson said to them, Though ye may have dealt thus with her, verily I will be avenged of you, and afterwards I will cease.
And he smote them leg on thigh with a great overthrow; and went down and dwelt in a cave of the rock Etam.
And the Philistines went up, and encamped in Juda, and spread themselves abroad in Lechi.
And the men of Juda said, Why are ye come up against us? and the Philistines said, We are come up to bind Sampson, and to do to him as he has done to us.
And the three thousand men of Juda went down to the hole of the rock Etam, and they said to Sampson, Knowest thou not that the Philistines rule over us? and what is this that thou hast done to us? and Sampson said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.
And they said to him, We are come down to bind thee to deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines: and Sampson said to them, Swear to me that ye will not fall upon me yourselves.
And they spoke to him, saying, Nay, but we will only bind thee fast, and deliver thee into their hand, and will by no means slay thee: and they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him from that rock.
And they came to Lechi: and the Philistines shouted, and ran to meet him: and the Spirit of the Lord came mightily upon him, and the ropes that were upon his arms became as tow which is burnt with fire; and his bonds were consumed from off his hands.
And he found the jaw-bone of an ass that had been cast away, and he put forth his hand and took it, and smote with it a thousand men.
And Sampson said, With the jaw-bone of an ass I have utterly destroyed them, for with the jaw-bone of an ass I have smitten a thousand men.
And it came to pass when he ceased speaking, that he cast the jaw-bone out of his hand; and he called that place the Lifting of the jaw-bone.
And he was very thirsty, and wept before the Lord, and said, Thou hast been well pleased to grant this great deliverance by the hand of thy servant, and new shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand of the uncircumcised?
And God broke open a hollow place in the jaw, and there came thence water, and he drank; and his spirit returned and he revived: therefore the name of the fountain was called 'The well of the invoker,' which is in Lechi, until this day.
And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Take Aaron and his sons, and his robes and the anointing oil, and the calf for the sin-offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread,
and assemble the whole congregation at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
And Moses did as the Lord appointed him, and he assembled the congregation at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
And Moses said to the congregation, This is the thing which the Lord has commanded you to do.
And Moses brought nigh Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water,
and put on him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the tunic, and put on him the ephod;
and girded him with a girdle according to the make of the ephod, and clasped him closely with it: and put upon it the oracle, and put upon the oracle the Manifestation and the Truth.
And he put the mitre on his head, and put upon the mitre in front the golden plate, the most holy thing, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Moses took of the anointing oil,
and sprinkled of it seven times on the altar; and anointed the altar, and hallowed it, and all things on it, and the laver, and its foot, and sanctified them; and anointed the tabernacle and all its furniture, and hallowed it.
And Moses poured of the anointing oil on the head of Aaron; and he anointed him and sanctified him.
And Moses brought the sons of Aaron near, and put on them coast and girded them with girdles, and put on them bonnets, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Moses brought near the calf for the sin-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the calf of the sin-offering.
And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger; and he purified the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement upon it.
And Moses took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the lobe on the liver, and both the kidneys, and the fat that was upon them, and Moses offered them on the altar.
But the calf, and his hide, and his flesh, and his dung, he burnt with fire without the camp, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Moses brought near the ram for a whole-burnt-offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. And Moses slew the ram: and Moses poured the blood on the altar round about.
And he divided the ram by its limbs, and Moses offered the head, and the limbs, and the fat; and he washed the belly and the feet with water.
And Moses offered up the whole ram on the altar: it is a whole-burnt-offering for a sweet-smelling savour; it is a burnt-offering to the Lord, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Moses brought the second ram, the ram of consecration, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram, and he slew him;
and Moses took of his blood, and put it upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the great toe of his right foot.
And Moses brought near the sons of Aaron; and Moses put of the blood on the tips of their right ears, and on the thumbs of their right hands, and on the great toes of their right feet, and Moses poured out the blood on the altar round about.
And he took the fat, and the rump, and the fat on the belly, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and the right shoulder.
And from the basket of consecration, which was before the Lord, he also took one unleavened loaf, and one loaf made with oil, and one cake; and put them upon the fat, and the right shoulder:
and put them all on the hands of Aaron, and upon the hands of his sons, and offered them up for a wave-offering before the Lord.
And Moses took them at their hands, and Moses offered them on the altar, on the whole-burnt-offering of consecration, which is a smell of sweet savour: it is a burnt-offering to the Lord.
And Moses took the breast, and separated it for a heave-offering before the Lord, from the ram of consecration; and it became Moses' portion, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood that was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, and on his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
And he sanctified Aaron and his garments, and his sons, and the garments of his sons with him.
And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh in the tent of the tabernacle of witness in the holy place; and there ye shall eat it and the loaves in the basket of consecration, as it has been appointed me, the Lord saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat them.
And that which is left of the flesh and of the loaves burn ye with fire.
And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of witness for seven days, until the day be fulfilled, the day of your consecration; for in seven days shall he consecrate you,
as he did in this day on which the Lord commanded me to do so, to make an atonement for you.
And ye shall remain seven days at the door of the tabernacle of witness, day and night; ye shall observe the ordinances of the Lord, that ye die not; for so has the Lord God commanded me.
And Aaron and his sons performed all these commands which the Lord commanded Moses.
Make a joyful noise to the Lord, all the earth.
Serve the Lord with gladness; come before his presence with exultation.
Know that the Lord he is God; he made us, and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and his courts with hymns; give thanks to him, praise his name.
For the Lord is good, his mercy is for ever; and his truth endures to generation and generation.
Behold now, bless ye the Lord, all the servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Lift up your hands by night in the sanctuaries, and bless the Lord.
May the Lord, who made heaven and earth, bless thee out of Sion.
And it came to pass in the year in which king Ozias died, that I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, and the house was full of his glory.
And seraphs stood round about him: each one had six wings: and with two they covered their face, and with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew.
And one cried to the other, and they said, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.
And the lintel shook at the voice they uttered, and the house was filled with smoke.
And I said, Woe is me, for I am pricked to the heart; for being a man, and having unclean lips, I dwell in the midst of a people having unclean lips; and I have seen with mine eyes the King, the Lord of hosts.
And there was sent to me one of the seraphs, and he had in his hand a coal, which he had taken off the altar with the tongs:
and he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this has touched thy lips, and will take away thine iniquities, and will purge off thy sins.
And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go to this people? And I said, behold, I am here, send me. And he said, Go, and say to this people,
Ye shall hear indeed, but ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive.
For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them.
And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left desolate.
And after this God shall remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be multiplied.
And yet there shall be a tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.
For the great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and very speedy; the sound of the day of the Lord is made bitter and harsh.
A mighty day of wrath is that day, a day of affliction and distress, a day of desolation and destruction, a day of gloominess and darkness, a day of cloud and vapour,
a day of the trumpet and cry against the strong cities, and against the high towers.
And I will greatly afflict the men, and they shall walk as blind men, because they have sinned against the Lord; therefore he shall pour out their blood as dust, and their flesh as dung.
And their silver and their gold shall in nowise be able to rescue them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land shall be devoured by the fire of his jealously; for he will bring a speedy destruction on all them that inhabit the land.
I cried to the Lord with my voice, yea, my voice was addressed to God; and he gave heed to me.
In the day of mine affliction I earnestly sought the Lord; even with my hands by night before him, and I was not deceived; my soul refused to be comforted.
I remembered God, and rejoiced; I poured out my complaint, and my soul fainted. Pause.
All mine enemies set a watch against me: I was troubled, and spoke not.
I considered the days of old, and remembered ancient years.
And I meditated; I communed with my heart by night, and diligently searched my spirit, saying,
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be well pleased no more?
Will he cut off his mercy for ever, even for ever and ever?
Will God forget to pity? or will he shut up his compassions in his wrath? Pause.
And I said, Now I have begun; this is the change of the right hand of the Most High.
I remembered the works of the Lord; for I will remember thy wonders from the beginning.
And I will meditate on all thy works, and will consider thy doings.
O God, thy way is in the sanctuary; who is a great God as our God?
Thou art the God that doest wonders; thou hast made known thy power among the nations.
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Pause.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee, and feared; and the depths were troubled.
There was an abundant sound of waters: the clouds uttered a voice; for thine arrows went abroad.
The voice of thy thunder was abroad, and around thy lightnings appeared to the world; the earth trembled a quaked.
Thy way is in the sea, and thy paths in many waters, and thy footsteps cannot be known.
Thou didst guide thy people as sheep by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
What advantage has a man? for who knows what is good for a man in his life, during the number of the life of the days of his vanity? and he has spent them as a shadow; for who shall tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?
A good name is better than good oil; and the day of death than the day of birth.
It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the banquet house: since this is the end of every man; and the living man will apply good warning to his heart.
Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the countenance the heart will be made better.
The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.
It is better to hear a reproof of a wise man, than for a man to hear the song of fools.
As the sound of thorns under a caldron, so is the laughter of fools: this is also vanity.
for oppression makes a wise man mad, and destroys his noble heart.
The end of a matter is better than the beginning thereof: the patient is better than the high-minded.
Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger will rest in the bosom of fools.
Say not, What has happened, that the former days were better than these? for thou dost not enquire in wisdom concerning this.
Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and there is an advantage by it to them that see the sun.
For wisdom in its shadow is as the shadow of silver: and the excellence of the knowledge of wisdom will give life to him that has it.
Behold the works of God: for who shall be able to straighten him whom God has made crooked?
In the day of prosperity live joyfully, and consider in the day of adversity: consider, I say, God also has caused the one to agree with the other for this reason, that man should find nothing after him.
I have seen all things in the days of my vanity: there is a just man perishing in his justice, and there is an ungodly man remaining in his wickedness.
Be not very just; neither be very wise: lest thou be confounded.
Be not very wicked; and be not stubborn: lest thou shouldest die before thy time.
It is well for thee to hold fast by this; also by this defile not thine hand: for to them that fear God all things shall come forth well.
Wisdom will help the wise man more than ten mighty men which are in the city.
For there is not a righteous man in the earth, who will do good, and not sin
Also take no heed to all the words which ungodly men shall speak; lest thou hear thy servant cursing thee.
For many times he shall trespass against thee, and repeatedly shall he afflict thine heart; for thus also hast thou cursed others.
All these things have I proved in wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but it was far from me.
That which is far beyond what was, and a great depth, who shall find it out?
I and my heart went round about to know, and to examine, and to seek wisdom, and the account of things, and to know the folly and trouble and madness of the ungodly man.
And I find her to be, and I will pronounce to be more bitter than death the woman which is a snare, and her heart nets, who has a band in her hands: he that is good in the sight of God shall be delivered from her; but the sinner shall be caught by her.
Behold, this have I found, said the Preacher, seeking by one at a time to find out the account,
which my soul sought after, but I found not: for I have found one man of a thousand; but a woman in all these I have not found.
But, behold, this have I found, that God made man upright; but they have sought out many devices.
And these are the stages of the children of Israel, as they went out from the land of Egypt with their host by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
And Moses wrote their removals and their stages, by the word of the Lord: and these are the stages of their journeying.
They departed from Ramesses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the passover the children of Israel went forth with a high hand before all the Egyptians.
And the Egyptians buried those that died of them, even all that the Lord smote, every first-born in the land of Egypt; also the Lord executed vengeance on their gods.
And the children of Israel departed from Ramesses, and encamped in Socchoth:
and they departed from Socchoth and encamped in Buthan, which is a part of the wilderness.
And they departed from Buthan and encamped at the mouth of Iroth, which is opposite Beel-sepphon, and encamped opposite Magdol.
And they departed from before Iroth, and crossed the middle of the sea into the wilderness; and they went a journey of three days through the wilderness, and encamped in Picriae.
And they departed from Picriae, and came to Aelim; and in Aelim were twelve fountains of water, and seventy palm-trees, and they encamped there by the water.
And they departed from Aelim, and encamped by the Red Sea.
And they departed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin.
And they departed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Raphaca.
And they departed from Raphaca, and encamped in Aelus.
And they departed from Aelus, and encamped in Raphidin; and there was no water there for the people to drink.
And they departed from Raphidin, and encamped in the wilderness of Sina.
And they departed from the wilderness of Sina, and encamped at the Graves of Lust.
And they departed from the Graves of Lust, and encamped in Aseroth.
And they departed from Aseroth, and encamped in Rathama.
And they departed from Rathama, and encamped in Remmon Phares.
And they departed from Remmon Phares, and encamped in Lebona.
And they departed from Lebona, and encamped in Ressan.
And they departed from Ressan, and encamped in Makellath.
And they departed from Makellath, and encamped in Saphar.
And they departed from Saphar, and encamped in Charadath.
And they departed from Charadath, and encamped in Makeloth.
And they departed from Makeloth, and encamped in Kataath.
And they departed from Kataath, and encamped in Tarath.
And they departed from Tarath, and encamped in Mathecca.
And they departed from Mathecca, and encamped in Selmona.
And they departed from Selmona, and encamped in Masuruth.
And they departed from Masuruth, and encamped in Banaea.
And they departed from Banaea, and encamped in the mountain Gadgad.
And they departed from the mountain Gadgad, and encamped in Etebatha.
And they departed from Etebatha, and encamped in Ebrona.
And they departed from Ebrona, and encamped in Gesion Gaber.
And they departed from Gesion Gaber, and encamped in the wilderness of Sin; and they departed from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in the wilderness of Pharan; this is Cades.
And they departed from Cades, and encamped in mount Or near the land of Edom.
And Aaron the priest went up by the command of the Lord, and died there in the fortieth year of the departure of the children of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
And Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old, when he died in mount Or.
And Arad the Chananitish king (he too dwelt in the land of Chanaan) having heard when the children of Israel were entering the land
then they departed from mount Or, and encamped in Selmona.
And they departed from Selmona, and encamped in Phino.
And they departed from Phino, and encamped in Oboth.
And they departed from Oboth, and encamped in Gai, on the other side Jordan on the borders of Moab.
And they departed from Gai, and encamped in Daebon Gad.
And they departed from Daebon Gad, and encamped in Gelmon Deblathaim.
And they departed from Gelmon Deblathaim, and encamped on the mountains of Abarim, over against Nabau.
And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped on the west of Moab, at Jordan by Jericho.
And they encamped by Jordan between Aesimoth, as far as Belsa to the west of Moab.
And the Lord spoke to Moses at the west of Moab by Jordan at Jericho, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye are to pass over Jordan into the land of Chanaan.
And ye shall destroy all that dwell in the land before your face, and ye shall abolish their high places, and all their molten images ye shall destroy, and ye shall demolish all their pillars.
And ye shall destroy all the inhabitants of the land, and ye shall dwell in it, for I have given their land to you for an inheritance.
And ye shall inherit their land according to your tribes; to the greater number ye shall give the larger possession, and to the smaller ye shall give the less possession; to whatsoever part a man's name shall go forth by lot, there shall be his property: ye shall inherit according to the tribes of your families.
But if ye will not destroy the dwellers in the land from before you, then it shall come to pass that whomsoever of them ye shall leave shall be thorns in your eyes, and darts in your sides, and they shall be enemies to you on the land on which ye shall dwell;
and it shall come to pass that as I had determined to do to them, so I will do to you.
So Tobit made an end of praising God.
And he was eight and fifty years old when he lost his sight, which was restored to him after eight years: and he gave alms, and he increased in the fear of the Lord God, and praised him.
And when he was very aged he called his son, and the sons of his son, and said to him, My son, take thy children; for, behold, I am aged, and am ready to depart out of this life.
Go into Media my son, for I surely believe those things which Jonas the prophet spake of Nineve, that it shall be overthrown; and that for a time peace shall rather be in Media; and that our brethren shall lie scattered in the earth from that good land: and Jerusalem shall be desolate, and the house of God in it shall be burned, and shall be desolate for a time;
And that again God will have mercy on them, and bring them again into the land, where they shall build a temple, but not like to the first, until the time of that age be fulfilled; and afterward they shall return from all places of their captivity, and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be built in it for ever with a glorious building, as the prophets have spoken thereof.
And all nations shall turn, and fear the Lord God truly, and shall bury their idols.
So shall all nations praise the Lord, and his people shall confess God, and the Lord shall exalt his people; and all those which love the Lord God in truth and justice shall rejoice, shewing mercy to our brethren.
And now, my son, depart out of Nineve, because that those things which the prophet Jonas spake shall surely come to pass.
But keep thou the law and the commandments, and shew thyself merciful and just, that it may go well with thee.
And bury me decently, and thy mother with me; but tarry no longer at Nineve. Remember, my son, how Aman handled Achiacharus that brought him up, how out of light he brought him into darkness, and how he rewarded him again: yet Achiacharus was saved, but the other had his reward: for he went down into darkness. Manasses gave alms, and escaped the snares of death which they had set for him: but Aman fell into the snare, and perished.
Wherefore now, my son, consider what alms doeth, and how righteousness doth deliver. When he had said these things, he gave up the ghost in the bed, being an hundred and eight and fifty years old; and he buried him honourably.
And when Anna his mother was dead, he buried her with his father. But Tobias departed with his wife and children to Ecbatane to Raguel his father in law,
Where he became old with honour, and he buried his father and mother in law honourably, and he inherited their substance, and his father Tobit's.
And he died at Ecbatane in Media, being an hundred and seven and twenty years old.
But before he died he heard of the destruction of Nineve, which was taken by Nabuchodonosor and Assuerus: and before his death he rejoiced over Nineve.
Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, and seek the Lord: look to the solid rock, which ye have hewn, and to the hole of the pit which ye have dug.
Look to Abraam your father, and to Sarrha that bore you: for he was alone when I called him, and blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him.
And now I will comfort thee, O Sion: and I have comforted all her desert places; and I will make her desert places as a garden, and her western places as the garden of the Lord; they shall find in her gladness and exultation, thanksgiving and the voice of praise.
Hear me, hear me, my people; and ye kings, hearken to me: for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment shall be for a light of the nations.
My righteousness speedily draws nigh, and my salvation shall go forth as light, and on mine arm shall the Gentiles trust: the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust.
Lift up your eyes to the sky, and look on the earth beneath: for the sky was darkened like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and the inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my righteousness shall not fail.
Hear me, ye that know judgment, the people in whose heart is my law: fear not the reproach of men, and be not overcome by their contempt.
For as a garment will be devoured by time, and as wool will be devoured by a moth, so shall they be consumed; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation for all generations.
Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, and put on the strength of thine arm; awake as in the early time, as the ancient generation.
Art thou not it that dried the sea, the water, even the abundance of the deep; that made the depths of the sea a way of passage for the delivered and redeemed?
for by the help of the Lord they shall return, and come to Sion with joy and everlasting exultation, for praise and joy shall come upon their head: pain, and grief, and groaning, have fled away.
I, even I, am he that comforts thee: consider who thou art, that thou wast afraid of mortal man, and of the son of man, who are withered as grass.
And thou hast forgotten God who made thee, who made the sky and founded the earth; and thou wert continually afraid because of the wrath of him that afflicted thee: for whereas he counselled to take thee away, yet now where is the wrath of him that afflicted thee?
For in thy deliverance he shall not halt, nor tarry;
for I am thy God, that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of hosts is my name.
I will put my words into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of mine hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and the Lord shall say to Sion, Thou art my people.
Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: for thou hast drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of wrath:
and there was none to comfort thee of all the children whom thou borest; and there was none to take hold of thine hand, not even of all the children whom thou has reared.
Wherefore these things are against thee; who shall sympathize with thee in thy grief? downfall, and destruction, famine, and sword: who shall comfort thee?
Thy sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to faint by the Lord God.
Therefore hear, thou afflicted one, and drunken, but not with wine;
thus saith the Lord God that judges his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my wrath; and thou shalt not drink it any more.
And I will give it into the hands of them that injured thee, and them that afflicted thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may pass over: and thou didst level thy body with the ground to them passing by without.
O God, my God, attend to me: why hast thou forsaken me? the account of my transgressions is far from my salvation.
O my God, I will cry to thee by day, but thou wilt not hear: and by night, and it shall not be accounted for folly to me.
But thou, the praise of Israel, dwellest in a sanctuary.
Our fathers hoped in thee; they hoped, and thou didst deliver them.
They cried to thee, and were saved: they hoped in thee, and were not ashamed.
But I am a worm, and not a man; a reproach of men, and scorn of the people.
All that saw me mocked me: they spoke with their lips, they shook the head, saying,
He hoped in the Lord: let him deliver him, let him save him, because he takes pleasure in him.
For thou art he that drew me out of the womb; my hope from my mother's breasts.
I was cast on thee from the womb: thou art my God from my mother's belly.
Stand not aloof from me; for affliction is near; for there is no helper.
Many bullocks have compassed me: fat bulls have beset me round.
They have opened their mouth against me, as a ravening and roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are loosened: my heart in the midst of my belly is become like melting wax.
My strength is dried up, like a potsherd; and my tongue is glued to my throat; and thou hast brought me down to the dust of death.
For many dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked doers has beset me round: they pierced my hands and my feet.
They counted all my bones; and they observed and looked upon me.
They parted my garments among themselves, and cast lots upon my raiment.
But thou, O Lord, remove not my help afar off: be ready for mine aid.
Deliver my soul from the sword; my only-begotten one from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth; and regard my lowliness from the horns of the unicorns.
I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the church will I sing praise to thee.
Ye that fear the Lord, praise him; all ye seed of Jacob, glorify him: let all the seed of Israel fear him.
For he has not despised nor been angry at the supplication of the poor; nor turned away his face from me; but when I cried to him, he heard me.
My praise is of thee in the great congregation: I will pay my vows before them that fear him.
The poor shall eat and be satisfied; and they shall praise the Lord that seek him: their heart shall live for ever.
All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the governor of the nations.
All the fat ones of the earth have eaten and worshipped: all that go down to the earth shall fall down before him: my soul also lives to him.
And my seed shall serve him: the generation that is coming shall be reported to the Lord.
And they shall report his righteousness to the people that shall be born, whom the Lord has made.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, I have made thee a god to Pharao, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.
And thou shalt say to him all things that I charge thee, and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharao, that he should send forth the children of Israel out of his land.
And I will harden the heart of Pharao, and I will multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
And Pharao will not hearken to you, and I will lay my hand upon Egypt; and will bring out my people the children of Israel with my power out of the land of Egypt with great vengeance.
And all the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord, stretching out my hand upon Egypt, and I will bring out the children of Israel out of the midst of them.
And Moses and Aaron did as the Lord commanded them, so did they.
And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron his brother was eighty-three years old, when he spoke to Pharao.
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Now if Pharao should speak to you, saying, Give us a sign or a wonder, then shalt thou say to thy brother Aaron, Take thy rod and cast it upon the ground before Pharao, and before his servants, and it shall become a serpent.
And Moses and Aaron went in before Pharao, and before his servants, and they did so, as the Lord commanded them; and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharao, and before his servants, and it became a serpent.
But Pharao called together the wise men of Egypt, and the sorcerers, and the charmers also of the Egyptians did likewise with their sorceries.
And they cast down each his rod, and they became serpents, but the rod of Aaron swallowed up their rods.
and the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he hearkened not to them, as the Lord charged them.
and the Lord said to Moses, The heart of Pharao is made hard, so that he should not let the people go.
Go to Pharao early in the morning: behold, he goes forth to the water; and thou shalt meet him on the bank of the river, and thou shalt take in thine hand the rod that was turned into a serpent.
And thou shalt say to him, The Lord God of the Hebrews has sent me to thee, saying, Send my people away, that they may serve me in the wilderness, and, behold, hitherto thou hast not hearkened.
These things saith the Lord: Hereby shalt thou know that I am the Lord: behold, I strike with the rod that is in my hand on the water which is in the river, and it shall change it into blood.
And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall stink thereupon, and the Egyptians shall not be able to drink water from the river.
And the Lord said to Moses, Say to thy brother Aaron, Take thy rod in thy hand, and stretch forth thy hand over the waters of Egypt, and over their rivers, and over their canals, and over their ponds, and over all their standing water, and it shall become blood: and there was blood in all the land of Egypt, both in vessels of wood and of stone.
and Moses and Aaron did so, as the Lord commanded them; and Aaron having lifted up his hand with his rod, smote the water in the river before Pharao, and before his servants, and changed all the water in the river into blood.
And the fish in the river died, and the river stank thereupon; and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river, and the blood was in all the land of Egypt.
And the charmers also of the Egyptians did so with their sorceries; and the heart of Pharao was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, even as the Lord said.
And Pharao turned and entered into his house, nor did he fix his attention even on this thing.
And all the Egyptians dug round about the river, so as to drink water, for they could not drink water from the river.
and seven days were fulfilled after the Lord has smitten the river.
They meditated troubles, and wrought wickedness on their beds, and they put it in execution with the daylight; for they have not lifted up their hands to God.
And they desired fields, and plundered orphans, and oppressed families, and spoiled a man and his house, even a man and his inheritance.
Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I devise evils against this family, out of which ye shall not lift up your necks, neither shall ye walk upright speedily: for the time is evil.
In that day shall a parable be taken up against you, and a plaintive lamentation shall be uttered, saying, We are thoroughly miserable: the portion of my people has been measured out with a line, and there was none to hinder him so as to turn him back; your fields have been divided.
Therefore thou shalt have no one to cast a line for the lot.
Weep not with tears in the assembly of the Lord, neither let any weep for these things; for he shall not remove the reproaches,
who says, The house of Jacob has provoked the Spirit of the Lord; are not these his practices? Are not the Lord's words right with him? and have they not proceeded correctly?
Even beforetime my people withstood him as an enemy against his peace; they have stripped off his skin to remove hope in the conflict of war.
The leaders of my people shall be cast forth from their luxurious houses; they are rejected because of their evil practices; draw ye near to the everlasting mountains.
Arise thou, and depart; for this is not thy rest because of uncleanness: ye have been utterly destroyed;
ye have fled, no one pursuing you: thy spirit has framed falsehood, it has dropped on thee for wine and strong drink. But it shall come to pass, that out of the dropping of this people,
Jacob shall be completely gathered with all his people: I will surely receive the remnant of Israel; I will cause them to return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in the midst of their fold: they shall rush forth from among men through the breach made before them:
they have broken through, and passed the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone out before them, and the Lord shall lead them.
But Job answered and said,
To whom dost thou attach thyself, or whom art thou going to assist? is it not he that has much strength, and he who has a strong arm?
To whom hast thou given counsel? is it not to him who has all wisdom? whom wilt thou follow? is it not one who has the greatest power?
To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose breath is it that has come forth from thee?
He has calmed the sea with his might, and by his wisdom the whale has been overthrown.
And David rose up from thence, and dwelt in the narrow passes of Engaddi.
And it came to pass when Saul returned from pursuing after the Philistines, that it was reported to him, saying, David is in the wilderness of Engaddi.
And he took with him three thousand men, chosen out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of Saddaeem.
And he came to the flocks of sheep that were by the way, and there was a cave there; and Saul went in to make preparation, and David and his men were sitting in the inner part of the cave.
And the men of David said to him, Behold, this is the day of which the Lord spoke to thee, that he would deliver thine enemy into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as it is good in thy sight. So David arose and cut off the skirt of Saul's garment secretly.
And it came to pass after this that David's heart smote him, because he had cut off the skirt of his garment.
And David said to his men, The Lord forbid it me, that I should do this ting to my lord the anointed of the Lord, to lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord.
So David persuaded his men by his words, and did not suffer them to arise and slay Saul: and Saul arose and went his way.
And David rose up and went after him out of the cave: and David cried after Saul, saying, My lord, O king! and Saul looked behind him, and David bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance to him.
And David said to Saul, Why dost thou hearken to the words of the people, saying, Behold, David seeks thy life?
Behold, thine eyes have seen this day how that the Lord has delivered thee this day into my hands in the cave; and I would not slay thee, but spared thee, and said, I will not lift up my hand against my lord, for he is the Lord's anointed.
And behold, the skirt of thy mantle is in my hand, I cut off the skirt, and did not slay thee: know then and see to-day, there is no evil in my hand, nor impiety, nor rebellion; and I have not sinned against thee, yet thou layest snares for my soul to take it.
The Lord judge between me and thee, and the Lord requite thee on thyself: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
As the old proverb says, Transgression will proceed from the wicked ones: but my hand shall not be upon thee.
And now after whom dost thou come forth, O king of Israel? After whom dost thou pursue? After a dead dog, and after a flea?
The Lord be judge and umpire between me and thee, the Lord look upon and judge my cause, and rescue me out of thy hand.
And it came to pass when David had finished speaking these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this thy voice, Son David? And Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.
And Saul said to David, Thou art more righteous that I, for thou hast recompensed me good, but I have recompensed thee evil.
And thou hast told me to-day what good thou hast done me, how the Lord shut me up into thy hands to-day, and thou didst not slay me.
And if any one should find his enemy in distress, and should send him forth in a good way, then the Lord will reward him good, as thou has done this day.
And now, behold, I know that thou shalt surely reign, and the kingdom of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
Now then swear to me by the Lord, that thou wilt not destroy my seed after me, that thou wilt not blot out my name from the house of my father.
So David swore to Saul: and Saul departed to his place, and David and his men went up to the strong-hold of Messera.
And Israel sojourned in Sattin, and the people profaned itself by going a-whoring after the daughters of Moab.
And they called them to the sacrifices of their idols; and the people ate of their sacrifices, and worshipped their idols.
And Israel consecrated themselves to Beel-phegor; and the Lord was very angry with Israel.
And the Lord said to Moses, Take all the princes of the people, and make them examples of judgment for the Lord in the face of the sun, and the anger of the Lord shall be turned away from Israel.
And Moses said to the tribes of Israel, Slay ye every one his friend that is consecrated to Beel-phegor.
And, behold, a man of the children of Israel came and brought his brother to a Madianitish woman before Moses, and before all the congregation of the children of Israel; and they were weeping at the door of the tabernacle of witness.
And Phinees the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, and rose out of the midst of the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand,
and went in after the Israelitish man into the chamber, and pierced them both through, both the Israelitish man, and the woman through her womb; and the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.
Send forth thy bread upon the face of the water: for thou shalt find it after many days.
Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil there shall be upon the earth.
If the clouds be filled with rain, they pour it out upon the earth: and if a tree fall southward, or if it fall northward, in the place where the tree shall fall, there it shall be.
He that observes the wind sows not; and he that looks at the clouds will not reap.
Among whom none knows what is the way of the wind: as the bones are hid in the womb of a pregnant woman, so thou shalt not know the works of God, even all things whatsoever he shall do.
In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening let not thine hand be slack: for thou knowest not what sort shall prosper, whether this or that, or whether both shall be good alike.
Moreover the light is sweet, and it is good for the eyes to see the sun.
For even if a man should live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All that comes is vanity.

Come down, sit on the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon: sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and luxurious.
Take a millstone, grind meal: remove thy veil, uncover thy white hairs, make bare the leg, pass through the rivers.
Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproaches shall be brought to light: I will exact of thee due vengeance, I will no longer deliver thee to men.
Thy deliverer is the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name.
Sit thou down pierced with woe, go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no more be called the strength of a kingdom.
I have been provoked with my people; thou hast defiled mine inheritance: I gave them into thy hand, but thou didst not extend mercy to them: thou madest the yoke of the aged man very heavy,
and saidst, I shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not perceive these things in thine heart, nor didst thou remember the latter end.
But now hear these words, thou luxurious one, who art the one that sits at ease, that is secure, that says in her heart, I am, and there is not another; I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know bereavement.
But now these two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, the loss of children and widowhood shall come suddenly upon thee, for thy sorcery, for the strength of thine enchantments,
for thy trusting in wickedness: for thou saidst, I am, and there is not another: know thou, the understanding of these things and thy harlotry shall be thy shame; for thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is not another.
And destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be aware; there shall be a pit, and thou shalt fall into it: and grief shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be clear; and destruction shall come suddenly upon thee, and thou shalt not know.
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the abundance of thy sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy youth; if thou canst be profited.
Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand and deliver thee, let them that see the stars tell thee what is about to come upon thee.
Behold, they all shall be burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit thou upon them;
these shall be thy help. Thou hast wearied thyself with traffic from thy youth: every man has wandered to his own home, but thou shalt have no deliverance.
But now the youngest have laughed me to scorn, now they reprove me in their turn, whose fathers I set at nought; whom I did not deem worthy to be with my shepherd dogs.

One is childless in want and famine, such as they that fled but lately the distress and misery of drought.
Who compass the salt places on the sounding shore, who had salt herbs for their food, and were dishonorable and of no repute, in want of every good thing; who also ate roots of trees by reason of great hunger.
Thieves have risen up against me,
whose houses were the caves of the rocks, who lived under the wild shrubs.
They will cry out among the rustling bushes.
They are sons of fools and vile men, whose name and glory are quenched from off the earth.
But now I am their music, and they have me for a by-word.
And they stood aloof and abhorred me, and spared not to spit in my face.
For he has opened his quiver and afflicted me: they also have cast off the restraint of my presence.
My paths are ruined; for they have stripped off my raiment: he has shot at me with his weapons.
And he has pleaded against me as he will: I am overwhelmed with pains.
My pains return upon me; my hope is gone like the wind, and my safety as a cloud.
Even now my life shall be poured forth upon me; and days of anguish seize me.
And by night my bones are confounded; and my sinews are relaxed.
With great force my disease has taken hold of my garment: it has compassed me as the collar of my coat.
And thou hast counted me as clay; my portion in dust and ashes.
And I have cried to thee, but thou hearest me not: but they stood still, and observed me.
They attacked me also without mercy: thou hast scourged me with a strong hand.
And thou hast put me to grief, and hast cast me away from safety.
For I know that death will destroy me: for the earth is the house appointed for every mortal.
Yet I wept over every helpless man; I groaned when I saw a man in distress.
But I, when I waited for good things, behold, days of evils came the more upon me.
I am become a brother of monsters, and a companion of ostriches.
And my skin has been greatly blackened, and my bones are burned with heat.
My harp also has been turned into mourning, and my song into my weeping.
And the Lord said to Moses, I will yet bring one plague upon Pharao and upon Egypt, and after that he will send you forth thence; and whenever he sends you forth with every thing, he will indeed drive you out.

And the Lord gave his people favour in the sight of the Egyptians, and they lent to them; and the man Moses was very great before the Egyptians, and before Pharao, and before his servants.
And Moses said, These things saith the Lord, About midnight I go forth into the midst of Egypt.
And every first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharao that sits on the throne, even to the first-born of the woman-servant that is by the mill, and to the first-born of all cattle.

And Moses went forth from Pharao with wrath. And the Lord said to Moses, Pharao will not hearken to you, that I may greatly multiply my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
And Moses and Aaron wrought all these signs and wonders in the land of Egypt before Pharao; and the Lord hardened the heart of Pharao, and he did not hearken to send forth the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.
O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger.
For thy weapons are fixed in me, and thou hast pressed thy hand heavily upon me.
For there is no health in my flesh because of thine anger; there is no peace to my bones because of my sins.
For my transgressions have gone over mine head: they have pressed heavily upon me like a weighty burden.
My bruises have become noisome and corrupt, because of my foolishness.
I have been wretched and bowed down continually: I went with a mourning countenance all the day.
For my soul is filled with mockings; and there is no health in my flesh.
I have been afflicted and brought down exceedingly: I have roared for the groaning of my heart.
But all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidden from thee.
My heart is troubled, my strength has failed me; and the light of mine eyes is not with me.
My friends and my neighbours drew near before me, and stood still; and my nearest of kin stood afar off.
While they pressed hard upon me that sought my soul: and they that sought my hurt spoke vanities, and devised deceits all the day.
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and was as a dumb man not opening his mouth.
And I was as a man that hears not, and who has no reproofs in his mouth.
For I hoped in thee, O Lord: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
For I said, Lest mine enemies rejoice against me: for when my feet were moved, they spoke boastingly against me.
For I am ready for plagues, and my grief is continually before me.
For I will declare mine iniquity, and be distressed for my sin.
But mine enemies live, and are mightier than I: and they that hate me unjustly are multiplied.
They that reward evil for good slandered me; because I followed righteousness.
Forsake me not, O Lord my God: depart not from me.
Draw nigh to my help, O Lord of my salvation.
And it came to pass when the king sat in his house, and the Lord had given him an inheritance on every side free from all his enemies round about him;
that the king said to Nathan the prophet, Behold now, I live in a house of cedar, and the ark of the Lord dwells in the midst of a tent.
And Nathan said to the king, Go and do all that is in thine heart, for the Lord is with thee.
And it came to pass in that night, that the word of the Lord came to Nathan, saying,
Go, and say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord, Thou shalt not build me a house for me to dwell in.
For I have not dwelt in a house from the day that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt to this day, but I have been walking in a lodge and in a tent,
wheresoever I went with all Israel. Have I ever spoken to any of the tribes of Israel, which I commanded to tend my people Israel, saying, Why have ye not built me a house of Cedar?
And now thus shalt thou say to my servant David, Thus says the Lord Almighty, I took thee from the sheep-cote, that thou shouldest be a prince over my people, over Israel.
And I was with thee wheresoever thou wentest, and I destroyed all thine enemies before thee, and I made thee renowned according to the renown of the great ones on the earth.
And I will appoint a place for my people Israel, and will plant them, and they shall dwell by themselves, and shall be no more distressed; and the son of iniquity shall no more afflict them, as he has done from the beginning,
from the days when I appointed judges over my people Israel: and I will give thee rest from all thine enemies, and the Lord will tell thee that thou shalt build a house to him.
And it shall come to pass when thy days shall have been fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed after thee, even thine own issue, and I will establish his kingdom.
He shall build for me a house to my name, and I will set up his throne even for ever.
I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son. And when he happens to transgress, then will I chasten him with the rod of men, and with the stripes of the sons of men.
But my mercy I will not take from him, as I took it from those whom I removed from my presence.
And his house shall be made sure, and his kingdom for ever before me, and his throne shall be set up for ever.
According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so Nathan spoke to David.
And king David came in, and sat before the Lord, and said, Who am I, O Lord, my Lord, and what is my house, that thou hast loved me hitherto?
Whereas I was very little before thee, O Lord, my Lord, yet thou spokest concerning the house of thy servant for a long time to to come. And is this the law of man, O Lord, my Lord?
And what shall David yet say to thee? and now thou knowest thy servant, O Lord, my Lord.
And thou hast wrought for thy servant's sake, and according to thy heart thou hast wrought all this greatness, to make it known to thy servant,
that he may magnify thee, O my Lord; for there is no one like thee, and there is no God, but thou among all of whom we have heard with our ears.
And what other nation in the earth is as thy people Israel? whereas God was his guide, to redeem for himself a people to make thee a name, to do mightily and nobly, so that thou shouldest cast out nations an their tabernacles from the presence of thy people, whom thou didst redeem for thyself out of Egypt?
And thou has prepared for thyself thy people Israel to be a people for ever, and thou, Lord, art become their God.
And now, O my Lord, the Almighty Lord God of Israel, confirm the word for ever which thou hast spoken concerning thy servant and his house: and now as thou hast said,
Let thy name be magnified for ever.
Almighty Lord God of Israel, thou hast uncovered the ear of thy servant, saying, I will build thee a house: therefore thy servant has found in his heart to pray this prayer to thee.
And now, O Lord my Lord, thou art God; and thy words will be true, and thou hast spoken these good things concerning thy servant.
And now begin and bless the house of thy servant, that it may continue for ever before thee; for thou, O Lord, my Lord, hast spoken, and the house of thy servant shall be blessed with thy blessing so as to continue for ever.
And put my silver cup into the sack of the youngest, and the price of his corn. And it was done according to the word of Joseph, as he said.
The morning dawned, and the men were sent away, they and their asses.
And when they had gone out of the city, were not far off, then Joseph said to his steward, Arise, and pursue after the men; and thou shalt overtake them, and say to them, Why have ye returned evil for good?
And they said to him, Why does our lord speak according to these words? far be it from thy servants to do according to this word.
If we brought back to thee out of the land of Chanaan the money which we found in our sacks, how should we steal silver or gold out of the house of thy lord?
With whomsoever of thy servants thou shalt find the cup, let him die; and, moreover, we will be servants to our lord.
And he said, Now then it shall be as ye say; with whomsoever the cup shall be found, he shall be my servant, and ye shall be clear.
And we said to lord, The child will not be able to leave his father; but if he should leave his father, he will die.
But thou saidst to they servants, Except your younger brother come down with you, ye shall not see my face again.
And it came to pass, when we went up to thy servant our father, we reported to him the words of our lord.
And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.
And thy servant our father said to us, Ye know that my wife bore me two ;
and one is departed from me; and ye said that he was devoured of wild beasts, and I have not seen him until now.
If then ye take this one also from my presence, and an affliction happen to him by the way, then shall ye bring down my old age with sorrow to the grave.
Now then, if I should go in to they servant, and our father, and the boy should not be with us, (and his life depends on this life)
Hear these things, ye priests; and attend, O house of Israel; and hearken, O house of the king; for the controversy is with you, because ye have been a snare in Scopia, and as a net spread on Itabyrium,
And Ephraim saw his disease, and Judas his pain; then Ephraim went to the Assyrians, and sent ambassadors to king Jarim: but he could not heal you, and your pain shall in nowise cease from you.
Wherefore I am as a panther to Ephraim, and as a lion to the house of Juda: and I will tear, and go away; and I will take, and there shall be none to deliver.
I will go and return to my place, until they are brought to nought, and then shall they seek my face.
And these are the nations which the Lord left to prove Israel with them, all that had not known the wars of Chanaan.
Only for the sake of the generations of Israel, to teach them war, only the men before them knew them not.
The five lordships of the Phylistines, and every Chananite, and the Sidonian, and the Evite who dwelt in Libanus from the mount of Aermon to Laboemath.
And this was done in order to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commands of the Lord, which he charged their fathers by the hand of Moses.
And the children of Israel dwelt in the midst of the Chananite, and the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite.
And they took their daughters for wives to themselves, and they gave their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.
And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and forgot the Lord their God, and served Baalim and the groves.
And the Lord was very angry with Israel, and sold them into the hand of Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers: and the children of Israel served Chusarsathaim eight years.
And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and the Lord raised up a saviour to Israel, and he saved them, Gothoniel the son of Kenez, the brother of Chaleb younger than himself.
And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel; and he went out to war against Chusarsathaim: and the Lord delivered into his hand Chusarsathaim king of Syria of the rivers, and his hand prevailed against Chusarsathaim.
And the land was quiet forty years; and Gothoniel the son of Kenez died.
And the children of Israel continued to do evil before the Lord: and the Lord strengthened Eglom king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil before the Lord.
And he gathered to himself all the children of Ammon and Amalec, and went and smote Israel, and took possession of the city of Palm-trees.
And the children of Israel served Eglom the king of Moab eighteen years.
And the children of Israel cried to the Lord; and he raised up to them a saviour, Aod the son of Gera a son of Jemeni, a man who used both hands alike: and the children of Israel sent gifts by his hand to Eglom king of Moab.
And Aod made himself a dagger of two edges, of a span long, and he girded it under his cloak upon his right thigh.
And he went, and brought the presents to Eglom king of Moab, and Eglom was a very handsome man.
And it came to pass when Aod had made an end of offering his gifts, that he dismissed those that brought the gifts.
And he himself returned from the quarries that are by Galgal; and Aod said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king! and Eglom said to him, Be silent: and he sent away from his presence all who waited upon him.
And Aod went in to him; and he sat in his own upper summer chamber quite alone; and Aod said, I have a message from God to thee, O king: and Eglom rose up from his throne near him.
And it came to pass as he arose, that Aod stretched forth his left hand, and took the dagger off his right thigh, and plunged it into his belly;
and drove in also the haft after the blade, and the fat closed in upon the blade, for he drew not out the dagger from his belly.
And Aod went out to the porch, and passed out by the appointed guards, and shut the doors of the chamber upon him, and locked them.
And he went out: and Eglom's servants came, and saw, and behold, the doors of the upper chamber were locked; and they said, Does he not uncover his feet in the summer-chamber?
And they waited till they were ashamed, and, behold, there was no one that opened the doors of the upper chamber; and they took the key, and opened them; and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead upon the earth.
And Aod escaped while they were in a tumult, and no one paid attention to him; and he passed the quarries, and escaped to Setirotha.
And it came to pass when Aod came into the land of Israel, that he blew the horn in mount Ephraim, and the children of Israel came down with him from the mountain, and he was before them.
And he said to them, Come down after me, for the Lord God has delivered our enemies, even Moab, into our hand; and they went down after him, and seized on the fords of Jordan before Moab, and he did not suffer a man to pass over.
And they smote Moab on that day about ten thousand men, every lusty person and every mighty man; and not a man escaped.
So Moab was humbled in that day under the hand of Israel, and the land had rest eighty years; and Aod judged them till he died.
And after him rose up Samegar the son of Dinach, and smote the Philistines to the number of six hundred men with a ploughshare such as is drawn by oxen; and he too delivered Israel.
And Joshua gathered all the tribe of Israel to Selo, and convoked their elders, and their officers, and their judges, and set them before God.
And Joshua said to all the people, Thus says the Lord God of Israel, Your fathers at first sojourned beyond the river, even Thara, the father of Abraam and the father of Nachor; and they served other gods.
And I took your father Abraam from the other side of the river, and I guided him through all the land, and I multiplied his seed;
and I gave to him Isaac, and to Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave to Esau mount Seir for him to inherit: and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and became there a great and populous and mighty nation: and the Egyptians afflicted them.
And I smote Egypt with the wonders that I wrought among them.
And afterwards God brought out our fathers from Egypt, and ye entered into the Red Sea; and the Egyptians pursued after our fathers with chariots and horses into the Red Sea.
And we cried aloud to the Lord; and he put a cloud and darkness between us and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea upon them, and covered them; and your eyes have seen all that the Lord did in the land of Egypt; and ye were in the wilderness many days.
And he brought us into the land of the Amorites that dwelt beyond Jordan, and the Lord delivered them into our hands; and ye inherited their land, and utterly destroyed them from before you.
And Balac, king of Moab, son of Sepphor, rose up, and made war against Israel, and sent and called Balaam to curse us.
But the Lord thy God would not destroy thee; and he greatly blessed us, and rescued us out of their hands, and delivered them to us.
And ye crossed over Jordan, and came to Jericho; and the inhabitants of Jericho fought against us, the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Chettite, and the Gergesite, and the Lord delivered them into our hands.
And he sent forth the hornet before you; and he drove them out from before you, even twelve kings of the Amorites, not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.
And he gave you a land on which ye did not labour, and cities which ye did not build, and ye were settled in them; and ye eat of vineyards and oliveyards which ye did not plant.
And now fear the Lord, and serve him in righteousness and justice; and remove the strange gods, which our fathers served beyond the river, and in Egypt; and serve the Lord.
But if it seem not good to you to serve the Lord, choose to yourselves this day whom ye will serve, whether the gods of your fathers that were on the other side of the river, or the gods of the Amorites, among whom ye dwell upon their land: but I and my house will serve the Lord, for he is holy.
And the people answered and said, Far be it from us to forsake the Lord, so as to serve other gods.
The Lord our God, he is God; he brought up us and our fathers from Egypt, and kept us in all the way wherein we walked, and among all the nations through whom we passed.
And the Lord cast out the Amorite, and all the nations that inhabited the land from before us: yea, we will serve the Lord, for he is our God.
And Joshua said to the people, Indeed ye will not be able to serve the Lord, for God is holy; and he being jealous will not forgive your sins and your transgressions.
Whensoever ye shall forsake the Lord and serve other gods, then he shall come upon you and afflict you, and consume you, because he has done you good.
And the people said to Joshua, Nay, but we will serve the Lord.
And Joshua said to the people, Ye are witnesses against yourselves, that ye have chosen the Lord to serve him.
And now take away the strange gods that are among you, and set your heart right toward the Lord God of Israel.
And the people said to Joshua, We will serve the Lord, and we will hearken to his voice.
So Joshua made a covenant with the people on that day, and gave them a law and an ordinance in Selo before the tabernacle of the God of Israel.
And he wrote these words in the book of the laws of God: and Joshua took a great stone, and set it up under the oak before the Lord.
And Joshua said to the people, Behold, this stone shall be among you for a witness, for it has heard all the words that have been spoken to it by the Lord; for he has spoken to you this day; and this stone shall be among you for a witness in the last days, whenever ye shall deal falsely with the Lord my God.
And Joshua dismissed the people, and they went every man to his place.
And it came to pass after these things that Joshua the son of Naue the servant of the Lord died, at the age of a hundred and ten years.
And they buried him by the borders of his inheritance in Thamnasarach in the mount of Ephraim, northward of the mount of Galaad: there they put with him into the tomb in which they buried him, the knives of stone with which he circumcised the children of Israel in Galgala, when he brought them out of Egypt, as the Lord appointed them; and there they are to this day.
And Israel served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that lived as long as Joshua, and all that knew all the works of the Lord which he wrought for Israel.
And the children of Israel brought up the bones of Joseph out of Egypt, and buried them in Sicima, in the portion of the land which Jacob bought of the Amorites who dwelt in Sicima for a hundred ewe-lambs; and he gave it to Joseph for a portion.
And it came to pass afterwards that Eleazar the high-priest the son of Aaron died, and was buried in Gabaar of Phinees his son, which he gave him in mount Ephraim. In that day the children of Israel took the ark of God, and carried it about among them; and Phinees exercised the priest's office in the room of Eleazar his father till he died, and he was buried in his own place Gabaar: but the children of Israel departed every one to their place, and to their own city: and the children of Israel worshipped Astarte, and Astaroth, and the gods of the nations round about them; and the Lord delivered them into the hands of Eglom king of Moab and he ruled over them eighteen years.
Woe to them that write wickedness; for when they write they do write wickedness,
perverting the cause of the poor, violently wresting the judgment of the needy ones of my people, that the widow may be a prey to them, and the orphan a spoil.
And what will they do in the day of visitation? for affliction shall come to you from afar: and to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory,
that ye may not fall into captivity? For all this his wrath is not turned away, but his hand is yet exalted.
Woe to the Assyrians; the rod of my wrath, and anger are in their hands.
I will send my wrath against a sinful nation, and I will charge my people to take plunder and spoil, and to trample the cities, and to make them dust.
But he meant not thus, neither did he devise thus in his soul: but his mind shall change, and that to destroy nations not a few.
And if they should say to him, Thou alone art ruler;
then shall he say, Have I not taken the country above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and have I not taken Arabia, and Damascus, and Samaria?
As I have taken them, I will also take all the kingdoms: howl, ye idols in Jerusalem, and in Samaria.
For as I did to Samaria and her idols, so will I do also to Jerusalem and her idols.
And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have finished doing all things on Mount Sion and Jerusalem, that I will visit upon the proud heart, even upon the ruler of the Assyrians, and upon the boastful haughtiness of his eyes.
For he said, I will act in strength, and in the wisdom of my understanding I will remove the boundaries of nations, and will spoil their strength.
And I will shake the inhabited cities: and I will take with my hand all the world as a nest: and I will even take them as eggs that have been left; and there is none that shall escape me, or contradict me.
Shall the axe glorify itself without him that hews with it? or shall the saw lift up itself without him that uses it, as if one should lift a rod or staff? but it shall not be so;
but the Lord of hosts shall send dishonour upon thine honour, and burning fire shall be kindled upon thy glory.
And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and he shall sanctify him with burning fire, and it shall devour the wood as grass.
In that day the mountains shall be consumed, and the hills, and the forests, and fire shall devour both soul and body: and he that flees shall be as one fleeing from burning flame.
And they that are left of them shall be a small number, and a child shall write them.
And it shall come to pass in that day that the remnant of Israel shall no more join themselves with, and the saved of Jacob shall no more trust in, them that injured them; but they shall trust in the Holy God of Israel, in truth.
And the remnant of Jacob shall trust on the mighty God.
And though the people of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved.
He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because the Lord will make a short work in all the world.
Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Be not afraid, my people who dwell in Sion, of the Assyrians, because he shall smite thee with a rod: for I am bringing a stroke upon thee, that thou mayest see the way of Egypt.
For yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease: but my wrath shall be against their council.
And God will stir up enemies against them, according to the stroke of Madiam in the place of affliction: and his wrath shall be by the way of the sea, even to the way that leads to Egypt.
And it shall come to pass in that day, that his yoke shall be taken away from thy shoulder, and his fear from thee, and the yoke shall be destroyed from off your shoulders.
For he shall arrive at the city of Angai, and shall pass on to Maggedo, and shall lay up his stores in Machmas.
And he shall pass by the valley, and shall arrive at Angai: fear shall seize upon Rama, the city of Saul.
The daughter of Gallim shall flee; Laisa shall hear; one shall hear in Anathoth.
Madebena also is amazed, and the inhabitants of Gibbir.
Exhort ye them to-day to remain in the way: exhort ye beckoning with the hand the mountain, the daughter of Sion, even ye hills that are in Jerusalem.
Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will mightily confound the glorious ones; and the haughty in pride shall be crushed, and the lofty shall be brought low:
and the lofty ones shall fall by the sword, and the Libanus shall fall with his lofty ones.
When the Lord turned the captivity of Sion, we became as comforted ones.
Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation: then would they say among the Gentiles,
The Lord has done great things among them. The Lord has done great things for us, we became joyful.
Turn, O Lord, our captivity, as the steams in the south.
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
They went on and wept as they cast their seeds; but they shall surely come with exultation, bringing their sheaves with them.
O God, hearken to my petition; attend to my prayer.
From the ends of the earth have I cried to thee, when my heart was in trouble: thou liftedst me up on a rock thou didst guide me:
because thou wert my hope, a tower of strength from the face of the enemy.
I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will shelter myself under the shadow of thy wings. Pause.
For thou, o God, hast heard my prayers; thou hast given an inheritance to them that fear thy name.
Thou shalt add days to the days of the king; thou shalt lengthen his years to all generations.
He shall endure for ever before God: which of them will seek out his mercy and truth?
So will I sing to thy name for ever and ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
Boast not of to-morrow; for thou knowest not what the next day shall bring forth.
Let thy neighbour, and not thine own mouth, praise thee; a stranger, and not thine own lips.
A stone is heavy, and sand cumbersome; but a fool's wrath is heavier than both.
Wrath is merciless, and anger sharp: but envy can bear nothing.
Open reproofs are better than secret love.
The wounds of a friend are more to be trusted than the spontaneous kisses of an enemy.
A full soul scorns honeycombs; but to a hungry soul even bitter things appear sweet.
As when a bird flies down from its own nest, so a man is brought into bondage whenever he estranges himself from his own place.
The heart delights in ointments and wines and perfumes: but the soul is broken by calamities.
Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not; and when thou art in distress go not into thy brother's house: better is a friend that is near than a brother living far off.
Son, be wise, that thy heart may rejoice; and remove thou from thyself reproachful words.
A wise man, when evils are approaching, hides himself; but fools pass on, and will be punished.
Take away the man's garment, (for a scorner has passed by) whoever lays waste another's goods.
Whosoever shall bless a friend in the morning with a loud voice, shall seem to differ nothing from one who curses him.
On a stormy day drops of rain drive a man out of his house; so also does a railing woman drive a man out of his own house.
The north wind is sharp, but it is called by name propitious.
Iron sharpens iron; and a man sharpens his friend's countenance.
He that plants a fig-tree shall eat the fruits of it: so he that waits on his own master shall be honoured.
As faces are not like other faces, so neither are the thoughts of men.
Hell and destruction are not filled; so also are the eyes of men insatiable. He that fixes his eye is an abomination to the Lord; and the uninstructed do not restrain their tongue.
Fire is the trial for silver and gold; and a man is tried by the mouth of them that praise him. The heart of the transgressor seeks after mischiefs; but an upright heart seeks knowledge.
Though thou scourge a fool, disgracing him in the midst of the council, thou wilt still in no wise remove his folly from him.
Do thou thoroughly know the number of thy flock, and pay attention to thine herds.
For a man has not strength and power for ever; neither does he transmit it from generation to generation.
Take care of the herbage in the field, and thou shalt cut grass, and gather the mountain hay;
that thou mayest have wool of sheep for clothing: pay attention to the land, that thou mayest have lambs.
My son, thou hast from me words very useful for thy life, and for the life of thy servants.
And there came men who were unclean by reason of a dead body, and they were not able to keep the passover on that day; and they came before Moses and Aaron on that day.
And those men said to Moses, We are unclean by reason of the dead body of a man: shall we therefore fail to offer the gift to the Lord in its season in the midst of the children of Israel?
And Moses said to them, stand there, and I will hear what charge the Lord will give concerning you.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Whatever man shall be unclean by reason of a dead body, or on a journey far off, among you, or among your posterity; he shall then keep the passover to the Lord,
in the second month, on the fourteenth day; in the evening they shall offer it, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs shall they eat it.
They shall not leave of it until the morrow, and they shall not break a bone of it; they shall sacrifice it according to the ordinance of the passover.
And whatsoever man shall be clean, and is not far off on a journey, and shall fail to keep the passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people, because he has not offered the gift to the Lord in its season: that man shall bear his iniquity.
And if there should come to you a stranger in your land, and should keep the passover to the Lord, he shall keep it according to the law of the passover and according to its ordinance: there shall be one law for you, both for the stranger, and for the native of the land.
And in the day in which the tabernacle was pitched the cloud covered the tabernacle, the place of the testimony; and in the evening there was upon the tabernacle as the appearance of fire till the morning.
So it was continually: the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night.
And when the cloud went up from the tabernacle, then after that the children of Israel departed; and in whatever place the cloud rested, there the children of Israel encamped.
The children of Israel shall encamp by the command of the Lord, and by the command of the Lord they shall remove: all the days in which the cloud overshadows the tabernacle, the children of Israel shall encamp. And whenever the cloud shall be drawn over the tabernacle for many days, then the children of Israel shall keep the charge of God, and they shall not remove.
And it shall be, whenever the cloud overshadows the tabernacle a number of days, they shall encamp by the word of the Lord, and shall remove by the command of the Lord.
And it shall come to pass, whenever the cloud shall remain from the evening till the morning, and in the morning the cloud shall go up, then shall they remove by day or by night.
And she lodged with her mother-in-law: and Noemin her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?
And now is not Booz our kinsman, with whose damsels thou wast? behold, he winnows barley this night in the floor.
But do thou wash, and anoint thyself, and put thy raiment upon thee, and go up to the threshing-floor: do not discover thyself to the man until he has done eating and drinking.
And it shall come to pass when he lies down, that thou shalt mark the place where he lies down, and shalt come and lift up the covering of his feet, and shalt lie down; and he shall tell thee what thou shalt do.
And Ruth said to her, All that thou shalt say, I will do.
And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law enjoined her.
And Booz ate and drank, and his heart was glad, and he came to lie down by the side of the heap of corn; and she came secretly, and lifted up the covering of his feet.
And it came to pass at midnight that the man was amazed, and troubled, and behold, a woman lay at his feet.
And he said, Who art thou? and she said, I am thine handmaid Ruth; spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid, for thou art a near relation.
And Booz said, Blessed be thou of the Lord God, my daughter, for thou hast made thy latter kindness greater than the former, in that thou followest not after young men, whether any be poor or rich.
And now fear not, my daughter, whatever thou shalt say I will do to thee; for all the tribe of my people knows that thou art a virtuous woman.
And now I am truly akin to thee; nevertheless there is a kinsman nearer than I.
Lodge here for the night, and it shall be in the morning, if he will do the part of a kinsman to thee, welllet him do it: but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, I will do the kinsman's part to thee, as the Lord lives; lie down till the morning.
And she lay at his feet until the morning; and she rose up before a man could know his neighbour; and Booz said, Let it not be known that a woman came into the floor.
And he said to her, Bring the apron that is upon thee: and she held it, and he measured six measures of barley, and put them upon her, and she went into the city.
And Ruth went in to her mother-in-law, and she said to her, My daughter! and Ruth told her all that the man had done to her.
And she said to her, He gave me these six measures of barley, for he said to me, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.
And she said, Sit still, my daughter, until thou shalt know how the matter will fall out; for the man will not rest until the matter be accomplished this day.
And the Lord said to Joshua, Fear not, nor be timorous: take with thee all the men of war, and arise, go up to Gai; behold, I have given into thy hands the king of Gai, and his land.
And thou shalt do to Gai, as thou didst to Jericho and its king; and thou shalt take to thyself the spoil of its cattle; set now for thyself an ambush for the city behind.
And Joshua and all the men of war rose to go up to Gai; and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men, and he sent them away by night.
And he charged them, saying, Do ye lie in ambush behind the city: do not go far from the city, and ye shall all be ready.
Land I and all with me will draw near to the city: and it shall come to pass when the inhabitants of Gai shall come forth to meet us, as before, that we will flee from before them.
And when they shall come out after us, we will draw them away from the city; and they will say, These men flee from before us, as also before.
And ye shall rise up out of the ambuscade, and go into the city.
Ye shall do according to this word, lo! I have commanded you.
And Joshua sent them, and they went to lie in ambush; and they lay between Baethel and Gai, westward of Gai.
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the people; and he went up, he and the elders before the people to Gai.
And all the men of war went up with him, and they went forward and came over against the city eastward.
And the ambuscade was on the west side of the city.
And it came to pass when the king of Gai saw it, he hasted and went out to meet them direct to the battle, he and all the people that were with him: and he knew not that there was an ambuscade formed against him behind the city.
And Joshua and Israel saw, and retreated from before them.
And they pursued after the children of Israel, and they themselves went to a distance from the city.
There was no one left in Gai who did not pursue after Israel; and they left the city open, and pursued after Israel.
And the Lord said to Joshua, Stretch forth thy hand with the spear that is in thy hand toward the city, for I have delivered it into thy hands; and the liers in wait shall rise up quickly out of their place.
And Joshua stretched out his hand and his spear toward the city, and the ambuscade rose up quickly out of their place; and they came forth when he stretched out his hand; and they entered into the city, and took it; and they hasted and burnt the city with fire.
And when the inhabitants of Gai looked round behind them, then they saw the smoke going up out of the city to heaven, and they were no longer able to flee this way or that way.
And Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambuscade had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they turned and smote the men of Gai.
And these came forth out of the city to meet them; and they were in the midst of the army, some being on this side, and some on that; and they smote them until there was not left of them one who survived and escaped.
And they took the king of Gai alive, and brought him to Joshua.
And when the children of Israel had ceased slaying all that were in Gai, and in the fields, and in the mountain on the descent, from whence they pursued them even to the end, then Joshua returned to Gai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.
And they that fell in that day, men and women, were twelve thousand: they slew all the inhabitants of Gai.
Beside the spoils that were in the city, all things which the children of Israel took as spoil for themselves according to the command of the Lord, as the Lord commanded Joshua.
And Joshua burnt the city with fire: he made it an uninhabited heap for ever, even to this day.
And he hanged the king of Gai on a gallows; and he remained on the tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave charge, and they took down his body from the tree, and cast it into a pit, and they set over him a heap of stones until this day.
He that loveth his son causeth him oft to feel the rod, that he may have joy of him in the end.
He that chastiseth his son shall have joy in him, and shall rejoice of him among his acquaintance.
He that teacheth his son grieveth the enemy: and before his friends he shall rejoice of him.
Though his father die, yet he is as though he were not dead: for he hath left one behind him that is like himself.
While he lived, he saw and rejoiced in him: and when he died, he was not sorrowful.
He left behind him an avenger against his enemies, and one that shall requite kindness to his friends.
He that maketh too much of his son shall bind up his wounds; and his bowels will be troubled at every cry.
An horse not broken becometh headstrong: and a child left to himself will be wilful.
Cocker thy child, and he shall make thee afraid: play with him, and he will bring thee to heaviness.
Laugh not with him, lest thou have sorrow with him, and lest thou gnash thy teeth in the end.
Give him no liberty in his youth, and wink not at his follies.
Bow down his neck while he is young, and beat him on the sides while he is a child, lest he wax stubborn, and be disobedient unto thee, and so bring sorrow to thine heart.
Chastise thy son, and hold him to labour, lest his lewd behaviour be an offence unto thee.
Better is the poor, being sound and strong of constitution, than a rich man that is afflicted in his body.
Health and good estate of body are above all gold, and a strong body above infinite wealth.
There is no riches above a sound body, and no joy above the joy of the heart.
Death is better than a bitter life or continual sickness.
Delicates poured upon a mouth shut up are as messes of meat set upon a grave.
What good doeth the offering unto an idol? for neither can it eat nor smell: so is he that is persecuted of the Lord.
He seeth with his eyes and groaneth, as an eunuch that embraceth a virgin and sigheth.
Give not over thy mind to heaviness, and afflict not thyself in thine own counsel.
The gladness of the heart is the life of man, and the joyfulness of a man prolongeth his days.
Love thine own soul, and comfort thy heart, remove sorrow far from thee: for sorrow hath killed many, and there is no profit therein.
Envy and wrath shorten the life, and carefulness bringeth age before the time.
FOR EGYPT, AGAINST THE POWER OF PHARAO NECHAO KING OF EGYPT, who was by the river Euphrates in Charmis, whom Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Joakim king of Juda.
The waters of Egypt shall come up like a river: and he said, I will go up, and will cover the earth, and will destroy the dwellers in it.
Mount ye the horses, prepare the chariots; go forth, ye warriors of the Ethiopians, and Libyans armed with shields; and mount, ye Lydians, bend the bow.
And that day shall be to the Lord our God a day of vengeance, to take vengeance on his enemies: and the sword of the Lord shall devour, and be glutted, and be drunken with their blood: for the Lord has a sacrifice from the land of the north at the river Euphrates.
Go up to Galaad, and take balm for the virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain hast thou multiplied thy medicines; there is no help in thee.
The nations have heard thy voice, and the land has been filled with thy cry: for the warriors have fainted fighting one against another, and both are fallen together.
THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE by Jeremias, concerning the coming of the king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt.
Proclaim it at Magdol, and declare it at Memphis: say ye, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured thy yew-tree.
Wherefore has Apis fled from thee? thy choice calf has not remained; for the Lord has utterly weakened him.
And thy multitude has fainted and fallen; and each one said to his neighbour, Let us arise, and return into our country to our people, from the Grecian sword.
Call ye the name of Pharao Nechao king of Egypt, Saon esbeie moed.
As I live, saith the Lord God, he shall come as Itabyrion among the mountains, and as Carmel that is on the sea.
O daughter of Egypt dwelling at home, prepare thee stuff for removing: for Memphis shall be utterly desolate, and shall be called Woe, because there are no inhabitants in it.
The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool.
The Lord shall send out a rod of power for thee out of Sion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies.
With thee is dominion in the day of thy power, in the splendours of thy saints: I have begotten thee from the womb before the morning.
The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.
The Lord at thy right hand has dashed in pieces kings in the day of his wrath.
He shall judge among the nations, he shall fill up the number of corpses, he shall crush the heads of many on the earth.
He shall drink of the brook in the way; therefore shall he lift up the head.
Observe the month of new corn, and thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God; because in the month of new corn thou camest out of Egypt by night.
And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called upon it.
Thou shalt not eat leaven with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread with it, bread of affliction, because ye came forth out of Egypt in haste; that ye may remember the day of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life.
Leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy borders for seven days, and there shall not be left of the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice at even on the first day until the morning.
thou shalt not have power to sacrifice the passover in any of the cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee.
But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, to have his name called there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the setting of the sun, at the time when thou camest out of Egypt.
And thou shalt boil and roast and eat it in the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and thou shalt return in the morning, and go to thy house.
Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a holiday, a feast to the Lord thy God: thou shalt not do in it any work, save what must be done by any one.
Seven weeks shalt thou number to thyself; when thou hast begun to put the sickle to the corn, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks.
And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the Lord thy God, accordingly as thy hand has power in as many things as the Lord thy God shall give thee.
And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which dwells among you, in whatsoever place the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name should be called there.
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and thou shalt observe and do these commands.
Thou shalt keep for thyself the feast of tabernacles seven days, when thou gatherest in thy produce from thy corn-floor and thy wine-press.
And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow that is in thy cities.
Seven days shalt thou keep a feast to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself; and if the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, then thou shalt rejoice.
Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: thou shalt not appear before the Lord thy God empty.
Each one according to his ability, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he has given thee.
Thou shalt make for thyself judges and officers in thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee in thy tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment:
they shall not wrest judgment, nor favour persons, nor receive a gift; for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.
Thou shalt justly pursue justice, that ye may live, and go in and inherit the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.
Thou shalt not plant for thyself a grove; thou shalt not plant for thyself any tree near the altar of thy God.
Thou shalt not set up for thyself a pillar, which the Lord thy God hates.
Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will cause to be heard in Rabbath a tumult of wars; and they shall become a waste and ruined place, and her altars shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel succeed to his dominion.
Howl, O Esebon, for Gai has perished; cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with sack-clothes, and lament; for Melchol shall go into banishment, his priests and his princes together.
Why do ye exult in the plains of the Enakim, thou haughty daughter, that trustest in thy treasures, that sayest, Who shall come in to me?
Behold, I will bring terror upon thee, saith the Lord, from all the country round about thee; and ye shall be scattered every one right before him, and there is none to gather you.
Blessed is the man that hath a virtuous wife, for the number of his days shall be double.
A virtuous woman rejoiceth her husband, and he shall fulfil the years of his life in peace.
A good wife is a good portion, which shall be given in the portion of them that fear the Lord.
Whether a man be rich or poor, if he have a good heart toward the Lord, he shall at all times rejoice with a cheerful countenance.
There be three things that mine heart feareth; and for the fourth I was sore afraid: the slander of a city, the gathering together of an unruly multitude, and a false accusation: all these are worse than death.
But a grief of heart and sorrow is a woman that is jealous over another woman, and a scourge of the tongue which communicateth with all.
An evil wife is a yoke shaken to and fro: he that hath hold of her is as though he held a scorpion.
A drunken woman and a gadder abroad causeth great anger, and she will not cover her own shame.
The whoredom of a woman may be known in her haughty looks and eyelids.
If thy daughter be shameless, keep her in straitly, lest she abuse herself through overmuch liberty.
Watch over an impudent eye: and marvel not if she trespass against thee.
She will open her mouth, as a thirsty traveller when he hath found a fountain, and drink of every water near her: by every hedge will she sit down, and open her quiver against every arrow.
The grace of a wife delighteth her husband, and her discretion will fatten his bones.
A silent and loving woman is a gift of the Lord; and there is nothing so much worth as a mind well instructed.
A shamefaced and faithful woman is a double grace, and her continent mind cannot be valued.
As the sun when it ariseth in the high heaven; so is the beauty of a good wife in the ordering of her house.
As the clear light is upon the holy candlestick; so is the beauty of the face in ripe age.
As the golden pillars are upon the sockets of silver; so are the fair feet with a constant heart.
There be two things that grieve my heart; and the third maketh me angry: a man of war that suffereth poverty; and men of understanding that are not set by; and one that returneth from righteousness to sin; the Lord prepareth such an one for the sword.
A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.
My words have been spoken by Godthe oracular answer of a king, whom his mother instructed.
What wilt thou keep, my son, what? the words of God. My firstborn son, I speak to thee: what? son of my womb? what? son of my vows?
Give not thy wealth to women, nor thy mind and living to remorse. Do all things with counsel: drink wine with counsel.
Princes are prone to anger: let them then not drink wine:
lest they drink, and forget wisdom, and be not able to judge the poor rightly.
Give strong drink to those that are in sorrow, and the wine to drink to those in pain:
that they may forget their poverty, and may not remember their troubles any more.
Open thy mouth with the word of God, and judge all fairly.
Open thy mouth and judge justly, and plead the cause of the poor and weak.
Who shall find a virtuous woman? for such a one is more valuable than precious stones.
The heart of her husband trusts in her: such a one shall stand in no need of fine spoils.
For she employs all her living for her husband's good.
Gathering wool and flax, she makes it serviceable with her hands.
She is like a ship trading from a distance: so she procures her livelihood.
And she rises by night, and gives food to her household, and appointed tasks to her maidens.
She views a farm, and buys it: and with the fruit of her hands she plants and a possession.
She strongly girds her loins, and strengthens her arms for work.
And she finds by experience that working is good; and her candle goes not out all night.
She reaches forth her arms to needful works, and applies her hands to the spindle.
Her husband is not anxious about those at home when he tarries anywhere abroad: for all her household are clothed.
She makes for her husband clothes of double texture, and garments for herself of fine linen and scarlet.
And her husband becomes a distinguished person in the gates, when he sits in council with the old inhabitants of the land.
She makes fine linens, and sells girdles to the Chananites: she opens her mouth heedfully and with propriety, and controls her tongue.
But she opens her mouth wisely, and according to law.
The ways of her household are careful, and she eats not the bread of idleness.
And her kindness to them sets up her children for them, and they grow rich, and her husband praises her.
Many daughters have obtained wealth, many have wrought valiantly; but thou hast exceeded, thou hast surpassed all.
Charms are false, and woman's beauty is vain: for it is a wise woman that is blessed, and let her praise the fear the Lord.
Give her of the fruit of her lips; and let her husband be praised in the gates.
And it came to pass when Laban heard the name of Jacob, his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him, and brought him into his house; and he told Laban all these sayings.
And Laban said to him, Thou art of my bones and of my flesh; and he was with him a full month.
And Laban said to Jacob, Surely thou shalt not serve me for nothing, because thou art my brother; tell me what thy reward is to be.
And Laban said to him, better that I should give her to thee, than that I should give her to another man; dwell with me.
And Jacob served for Rachel seven years, and they were before him as a few days, by reason of his loving her.
And Jacob said to Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled, that I may go in to her.
And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a marriage-feast.
And it was morning, and behold it was Lea; and Jacob said to Laban, What is this that thou hast done to me? did I not serve thee for Rachel? and wherefore hast thou deceived me?
And having conceived yet again, she bore a son, and said, Now yet again this time will I give thanks to the Lord; therefore she called his name, Juda; and ceased bearing.
And it came to pass when Samuel was old, that he made his sons judges over Israel.
And these are the names of his sons; Joel the first-born, and the name of the second Abia, judges in Bersabee.
And his sons did not walk in his way; and they turned aside after gain, and took gifts, and perverted judgments.
And the men of Israel gather themselves together, and come to Armathaim to Samuel,
and they said to him, Behold, thou art grown old, and thy sons walk not in thy way; and now set over us a king to judge us, as also the other nations have.
And the thing was evil in the eyes of Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us: and Samuel prayed to the Lord.
And the Lord said to Samuel, Hear the voice of the people, in whatever they shall say to thee; for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me from reigning over them.
According to all their doings which they have done to me, from the day that I brought them out of Egypt until this day, even as they have deserted me, and served other gods, so they do also to thee.
And now hearken to their voice; only thou shalt solemnly testify to them, and thou shalt describe to them the manner of the king who shall reign over them.
And Samuel spoke every word of the Lord to the people who asked of him a king.
And he said, This shall be the manner of the king that shall rule over you: he shall take your sons, and put them in his chariots, and among his horsemen, and running before his chariots,
and his manner shall be to make them to himself captains of hundreds and captains of thousands; and to reap his harvest, and gather his vintage, and prepare his instruments of war, and the implements of his chariots.
And he will take your daughters to be perfumers, and cooks, and bakers.
And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your good oliveyards, and give them to his servants.
And he will take the tithe of your seeds and your vineyards, and give it to his eunuchs, and to his servants.
And he will take your servants, and your handmaids, and your good herds and your asses, and will take the tenth of them for his works.
And he will tithe your flocks; and ye shall be his servants.
And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king whom ye have chosen to yourselves, and the Lord shall not hear you in those days, because ye have chosen to yourselves a king.
But the people would not hearken to Samuel; and they said to him, Nay, but there shall be a king over us.
An we also will be like all the nations; and our king shall judge us, and shall go out before us, and fight our battles.
And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and spoke them in the ears of the Lord.
And the Lord said to Samuel, Hearken to their voice, and appoint them a king. And Samuel said to the men of Israel, Let each man depart to his city.
Praise ye the Lord from the heavens: praise him in the highest.
Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.
Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars and light.
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and the water that is above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the Lord: for he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.
He has established them for ever, even for ever and ever: he has made an ordinance, and it shall not pass away.
Praise the Lord from the earth, ye serpents, and all deeps.
Fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy wind; the things that perform his word.
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:
wild beasts, and all cattle; reptiles, and winged birds:
kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the earth:
young men and virgins, old men with youths:
let them praise the name of the Lord: for his name only is exalted; his praise is above the earth and heaven,
and he shall exalt the horn of his people, there is a hymn for all his saints, even of the children of Israel, a people who draw near to him.
And he said, Take thy son, the beloved one, whom thou hast lovedIsaac, and go into the high land, and offer him there for a whole-burnt-offering on one of the mountains which I will tell thee of.
And Abraam rose up in the morning and saddled his ass, and he took with him two servants, and Isaac his son, and having split wood for a whole-burnt-offering, he arose and departed, and came to the place of which God spoke to him,
on the third day; and Abraam having lifted up his eyes, saw the place afar off.
And Abraam said to his servants, Sit ye here with the ass, and I and the lad will proceed thus far, and having worshipped we will return to you.
And Abraam took the wood of the whole-burnt-offering, and laid it on Isaac his son, and he took into his hands both the fire and the knife, and the two went together.
And Isaac said to Abraam his father, Father. And he said, What is it, son? And he said, Behold the fire and the wood, where is the sheep for a whole-burnt-offering?
And Abraam said, God will provide himself a sheep for a whole-burnt-offering, son. And both having gone together,
came to the place which God spoke of to him; and there Abraam built the altar, and laid the wood on it, and having bound the feet of Isaac his son together, he laid him on the altar upon the wood.
And an angel of the Lord called him out of heaven, and said, Abraam, Abraam. And he said, Behold, I .
surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand which is by the shore of the sea, and thy seed shall inherit the cities of their enemies.
And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because thou hast hearkened to my voice.
And Abraam returned to his servants, and they arose and went together to the well of the oath; and Abraam dwelt at the well of the oath.
And it came to pass after these things, that it was reported to Abraam, saying, Behold, Melcha herself too has born sons to Nachor thy brother,
Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all those of you that were reviewed, and those of you that were numbered from twenty years old and upward, all that murmured against me,
ye shall not enter into the land for which I stretched out my hand to establish you upon it; except only Chaleb the son of Jephonne, and Joshua the son of Naue.
And your little ones, who ye said should be a prey, them will I bring into the land; and they shall inherit the land, which ye rejected.
And your carcases shall fall in this wilderness.
And your sons shall be fed in the wilderness forty years, and they shall bear your fornication, until your carcases be consumed in the wilderness.
According to the number of the days during which ye spied the land, forty days, a day for a year, ye shall bear your sins forty years, and ye shall know my fierce anger.
the men that spoke evil reports against the land, even died of the plague before the Lord.
And Joshua the son of Naue and Chaleb the son of Jephonne still lived of those men that went to spy out the land.
And Moses spoke these words to all the children of Israel; and the people mourned exceedingly.
Go not up, for the Lord is not with you; so shall ye fall before the face of your enemies.
For Amalec and the Chananite are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword; because ye have disobeyed the Lord and turned aside, and the Lord will not be among you.
And having forced their passage, they went up to the top of the mountain; but the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses stirred not out of the camp.
And Amalec and the Chananite that dwelt in that mountain came down, and routed them, and destroyed them unto Herman; and they returned to the camp.
There was a certain man in the land of Ausis, whose name was Job; and than man was true, blameless, righteous, and godly, abstaining from everything evil.
And he had seven sons and three daughters.
And his cattle consisted of seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, five hundred she-asses in the pastures, and a very great household, and he had a great husbandry on the earth; and that man was most noble of the men of the east.
And his sons visiting one another prepared a banquet every day, taking with them also their three sisters to eat and drink with them.
And when the days of the banquet were completed, Job sent and purified them, having risen up in the morning, and offered sacrifices for them, according to their number, and one calf for a sin-offering for their souls: for Job said, Lest peradventure my sons have thought evil in their minds against God. Thus, then Job did continually.
And it came to pass on a day, that behold, the angels of God came to stand before the Lord, and the devil came with them.
And the Lord said to the devil, Whence art thou come? And the devil answered the Lord, and said, I am come from compassing the earth, and walking up and down in the world.
And the Lord said to him, Hast thou diligently considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a man blameless, true, godly, abstaining from everything evil?
Then the devil answered, and said before the Lord, Does Job worship the Lord for nothing?
Hast thou not made a hedge about him, and about his household, and all his possessions round about? and hast thou not blessed the works of his hands, and multiplied his cattle upon the land?
But put forth thine hand, and touch all that he has: verily he will bless thee to thy face.
Then the Lord said to the devil, Behold, I give into thine hand all that he has, but touch not himself. So the devil went out from the presence of the Lord.
And it came to pass on a certain day, that Job's sons and his daughters were drinking wine in the house of their elder brother.
And, behold, there came a messenger to Job, and said to him, The yokes of oxen were ploughing, and the she-asses were feeding near them;
and the spoilers came and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.
While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, Fire has fallen from heaven, and burnt up the sheep, and devoured the shepherds like wise; and I having escaped alone am come to tell thee.
While he was yet speaking, there came another messenger, and said to Job, The horsemen formed three companies against us, and surrounded the camels, and took them for a prey, and slew the servants with the sword; and I only escaped, and am come to tell thee.
While he is yet speaking, another messenger comes, saying to Job, While thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking with their elder brother,
suddenly a great wind came on from the desert, and caught the four corners of the house, and the house fell upon thy children, and they are dead; and I have escaped alone, and am come to tell thee.
So Job arose, and rent his garments, and shaved the hair of his head, and fell on the earth, and worshipped,
and said, I myself came forth naked from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither; the Lord gave, the Lord has taken away: as it seemed good to the Lord, so has it come to pass; blessed be the name of the Lord.
And the child Samuel ministered to the Lord before Heli the priest: and the word of the Lord was precious in those days, there was no distinct vision.
And it came to pass at that time that Heli was sleeping in his place; and his eyes began to fail, and could not see.
And the lamp of God was burning before it was trimmed, and Samuel slept in the temple, where was the ark of God.
And the Lord called, Samuel, Samuel; and he said, Behold, here am I.
And he ran to Heli, and said, Here am I, for thou didst call me: and he said, I did not call thee; return, go to sleep; and he returned and went to sleep.
And the Lord called again, Samuel, Samuel: and he went to Heli the second time, and said, Behold here am I, for thou didst call me: and he said, I called thee not; return, go to sleep.
And it was before Samuel knew the Lord, and before the word of the Lord was revealed to him.
And the Lord called Samuel again for the third time: and he arose and went to Heli, and said, Behold, I am here, for thou didst call me: and Heli perceived that the Lord had called the child.
And he said, Return, child, go to sleep; and it shall come to pass if he shall call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak for thy servant hears: and Samuel went and lay down in his place.
And the Lord came, and stood, and called him as before: and Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant hears.
And the Lord said to Samuel, Behold, I execute my words in Israel; whoever hears them, both his ears shall tingle.
In that day I will raise up against Heli all things that I have said against his house; I will begin, and I will make an end.
And I have told him that I will be avenged on his house perpetually for the iniquities of his sons, because his sons spoke evil against God, and he did not admonish them.
And it shall not go on so; I have sworn to the house of Eli, the iniquity of the house of Eli shall not be atoned for with incense or sacrifices for ever.
And Samuel slept till morning, and rose early in the morning, and opened the doors of the house of the Lord; and Samuel feared to tell Heli the vision.
And Heli said to Samuel, Samuel, my son; and he said, Behold, here am I.
And he said, What was the word that was spoken to thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: may God do these things to thee, and more also, if thou hide from me any thing of all the words that were spoken to thee in thine ears.
And Samuel reported all the words, and hid them not from him. And Heli said, He is the Lord, he shall do that which is good in his sight.
And Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him, and there did not fall one of his words to the ground.
And all Israel knew from Dan even to Bersabee, that Samuel was faithful as a prophet to the Lord.
And the Lord manifested himself again in Selom, for the Lord revealed himself to Samuel; and Samuel was accredited to all Israel as a prophet to the Lord from one end of the land to the other: and Heli was very old, and his sons kept advancing in wickedness, and their way was evil before the Lord.
And the Lord spoke all these words, saying:
I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.
Thou shalt have no other gods beside me.
Thou shalt not make to thyself an idol, nor likeness of anything, whatever things are in the heaven above, and whatever are in the earth beneath, and whatever are in the waters under the earth.
Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, recompensing the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me,
and bestowing mercy on them that love me to thousands of them, and on them that keep my commandments.
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord thy God will not acquit him that takes his name in vain.
Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.
Six days thou shalt labour, and shalt perform all thy work.
But on the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God; on it thou shalt do no work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy servant nor thy maidservant, thine ox nor thine ass, nor any cattle of thine, nor the stranger that sojourns with thee.
For in six days the Lord made the heaven and the earth, and the sea and all things in them, and rested on the seventh day; therefore the Lord blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it.
Honour thy father and thy mother, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long on the good land, which the Lord thy God gives to thee.
Thou shalt not commit adultery.
Thou shalt not steal.
Thou shalt not kill.
Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
O Lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath, neither chasten me in thine anger.
Pity me, O Lord; for I am weak: heal me, O Lord; for my bones are vexed.
My soul also is grievously vexed: but thou, O Lord, how long?
Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy's sake.
For in death no man remembers thee: and who will give thee thanks in Hades?
I am wearied with my groaning; I shall wash my bed every night; I shall water my couch with tears.
Mine eye is troubled because of my wrath; I am worn out because of all my enemies.
Depart from me, all ye that work iniquity; for the Lord has heard the voice of my weeping.
The Lord has hearkened to my petition; the Lord has accepted my prayer.
Let all mine enemies be put to shame and sore troubled: let them be turned back and grievously put to shame speedily.
Blessed be the Lord my God, who instructs my hands for battle, and my fingers for war.
My mercy, and my refuge; my helper, and my deliverer; my protector, in whom I have trusted; who subdues my people under me.
Lord, what is man, that thou art made known to him? or the son of man, that thou takest account of him?
Man is like to vanity: his days pass as a shadow.
O Lord, bow thy heavens, and come down: touch the mountains, and they shall smoke.
Send lightning, and thou shalt scatter them: send forth thine arrows, and thou shalt discomfit them.
Send forth thine hand from on high; rescue me, and deliver me out of great waters, out of the hand of strange children;
whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.
O God, I will sing a new song to thee: I will play to thee on a psaltery of ten strings.
Even to him who gives salvation to kings: who redeems his servant David from the hurtful sword.
Deliver me, and rescue me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity;
whose children are as plants, strengthened in their youth: their daughters are beautiful, sumptuously adorned after the similitude of a temple.
Their garners are full, and bursting with one kind of store after another; their sheep are prolific, multiplying in their streets.
Their oxen are fat: there is no falling down of a hedge, nor going out, nor cry in their folds.
Men bless the people to whom this lot belongs, but blessed is the people whose God is the Lord.
And the borders of the tribe of Juda according to their families were from the borders of Idumea from the wilderness of sin, as far as Cades southward.
And their borders were from the south as far as a part of the salt sea from the high country that extends southward.
And they proceed before the ascent of Acrabin, and go out round Sena, and go up from the south to Cades Barne; and go out to Asoron, and proceed up to Sarada, and go out by the way that is west of Cades.
And they go out to Selmona, and issue at the valley of Egypt; and the termination of its boundaries shall be at the sea: these are their boundaries southward.
And their boundaries eastward are all the salt sea as far as Jordan; and their borders from the north, and from the border of the sea, and from part of Jordan
the borders go up to Baethaglaam, and they go along from the north to Baetharaba, and the borders go on up to the stone of Baeon the son of Ruben.
And the borders continue on to the fourth part of the valley of Achor, and go down to Galgal, which is before the approach of Adammin, which is southward in the valley, and terminate at the water of the fountain of the sun; and their going forth shall be the fountain of Rogel.
And the borders go up to the valley of Ennom, behind Jebus southward; this is Jerusalem: and the borders terminate at the top of the mountain, which is before the valley of Ennom toward the sea, which is by the side of the land of Raphain northward.
And the border going forth from the top of the mountain terminates at the fountain of the water of Naphtho, and terminates at mount Ephron; and the border will lead to Baal; this is the city of Jarim.
And the border will go round from Baal to the sea, and will go on to the mount of Assar behind the city of Jarin northwards; this is Chaslon: and it will come down to the city of Sun, and will go on to the south.
And the border terminates behind Accaron northward, and the borders will terminate at Socchoth, and the borders will go on to the south, and will terminate at Lebna, and the issue of the borders will be at the sea; and their borders shall be toward the sea, the great sea shall be the boundary.
These are the borders of the children of Juda round about according to their families.
And to Chaleb the son of Jephone he gave a portion in the midst of the children of Juda by the command of God; and Joshua gave him the city of Arboc the metropolis of Enac; this is Chebron.
And Chaleb the son of Jephone destroyed thence the three sons of Enac, Susi, and Tholami, and Achima.
And Chaleb went up thence to the inhabitants of Dabir; and the name of Dabir before was the city of Letters.
And Chaleb said, Whosoever shall take and destroy the city of Letters, and master it, to him will I give my daughter Ascha to wife.
And Gothoniel the son of Chenez the brother of Chaleb took it; and he gave him Ascha his daughter to wife.
And it came to pass as she went out that she counselled him, saying, I will ask of my father a field; and she cried from off her ass; and Chaleb said to her, What is it?
And she said to him, Give me a blessing, for thou hast set me in the land of Nageb; give me Botthanis: and he gave her Gonaethla the upper, and Gonaethla the lower.
This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Juda.
And their cities were cities belonging to the tribe of the children of Juda on the borders of Edom by the wilderness, and Baeseleel, and Ara, and Asor,
and Icam, and Regma, and Aruel,
and Cades, and Asorionain, and Maenam,
and Balmaenan, and their villages,
and the cities of Aseron, this is Asor,

and Sekelac, and Macharim, and Sethennac,
and Labos, and Sale, and Eromoth; twenty-nine cities, and their villages.
In the plain country Astaol, and Raa, and Assa,
and Ramen, and Tano, and Iluthoth, and Maeani,
and Jermuth, and Odollam, and Membra, and Saocho, and Jazeca.
And Sacarim and Gadera, and its villages; fourteen cities, and their villages;

from Accaron, Gemna, and all the cities that are near Asedoth; and their villages.
Asiedoth, and her villages, and her hamlets; Gaza, and its villages and its hamlets as far as the river of Egypt, and the great sea is the boundary.
And in the hill country Samir, and Jether, and Socha,
and Renna and the city of Letters, this is Dabir;
and Anon, and Es, and Man, and Aesam,

And the Jebusite dwelt in Jerusalem, and the children of Juda could not destroy them; and the Jebusites dwelt in Jerusalem to this day.
My kinsman is gone down to his garden, to the beds of spice, to feed his flock in the gardens, and to gather lilies.
I am my kinsman's, and my kinsman is mine, who feeds among the lilies.
Thou art fair, my companion, as Pleasure, beautiful as Jerusalem, terrible as armies set in array.
Turn away thine eyes from before me, for they have ravished me: thy hair is as flocks of goats which have appeared from Galaad.
Thy teeth are as flocks of shorn sheep, that have gone up from the washing, all of them bearing twins, and there is none barren among them: thy lips are as a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely.
Thy cheek is like the rind of a pomegranate, being seen without thy veil.
There are sixty queens, and eighty concubines, and maidens without number.
My dove, my perfect one is one; she is the only one of her mother; she is the choice of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and the queens will pronounce her blessed, yea, and the concubines, and they will praise her.
Who is this that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, choice as the sun, terrible as armies set in array?
I went down to the garden of nuts, to look at the fruits of the valley, to see if the vine flowered, if the pomegranates blossomed.
There I will give thee my breasts: my soul knew it not: it made me as the chariots of Aminadab.
Return, return, O Sunamite; return, return, and we will look at thee. What will ye see in the Sunamite? She comes as bands of armies.
Why dost thou, O mighty man, boast of iniquity in thy mischief? All the day
thy tongue has devised unrighteousness; like a sharpened razor thou hast wrought deceit.
Thou hast loved wickedness more than goodness; unrighteousness better than to speak righteousness. Pause.
Thou has loved all words of destruction, and a deceitful tongue.
Therefore may God destroy thee for ever, may he pluck thee up and utterly remove thee from thy dwelling, and thy root from the land of the living. Pause.
And the righteous shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and say,
Behold the man who made not God his help; but trusted in the abundance of his wealth, and strengthened himself in his vanity.
But I am as a fruitful olive in the house of God: I have trusted in the mercy of God for ever, even for evermore.
I will give thanks to thee for ever, for thou hast done it: and I will wait on thy name; for it is good before the saints.
THE VISION OF THE DESERT. As though a whirlwind should pass through the desert, coming from a desert, even from such a land,
so a fearful and a grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals treacherously, the transgressor transgresses. The Elamites are upon me, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort myself.
Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see.
My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear.
Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare your shields.
For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see.
And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel.
Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias to the watch-tower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all night:
and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground.
Hear, ye that are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts which the God of Israel has declared to us. THE VISION OF IDUMEA.
Call to me out of Seir; guard ye the bulwarks.
I watch in the morning and the night: if thou wouldest enquire, enquire, and dwell by me.
Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening, or in the way of Daedan.
Ye that dwell in the country of Thaeman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty;
meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war.
For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling, and the glory of the sons of Kedar shall fail:
and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken it.
Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to thy name give glory, because of thy mercy and thy truth;
lest at any time the nations should say, Where is their God?
But our God has done in heaven and on earth, whatsoever he has pleased.
The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the works of men's hands.
They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see:
they have ears, but they cannot hear; they have noses, but they cannot smell;
they have hands, but they cannot handle; they have feet, but they cannot walk: they cannot speak through their throat.
Let those that make them become like to them, and all who trust in them.
The house of Israel trusts in the Lord: he is their helper and defender.
And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and departed from Sattin; and they came as far as Jordan, and lodged there before they crossed over.
And it came to pass after three days, that the scribes went through the camp;
and they charged the people, saying, When ye shall see the ark of the covenant of the Lord our God, and our priests and the Levites bearing it, ye shall depart from your places, and ye shall go after it.
But let there be a distance between you and it; ye shall stand as much as two thousand cubits from it. Do not draw nigh to it, that ye may know the way which ye are to go; for ye have not gone the way before.
And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, for to-morrow the Lord will do wonders among you.
And Joshua said to the priests, Take up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and go before the people: and the priests took up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and went before the people.
And the Lord said to Joshua, This day do I begin to exalt thee before all the children of Israel, that they may know that as I was with Moses, so will I also be with thee.
And now charge the priests that bear the ark of the covenant, saying, As soon as ye shall enter on a part of the water of Jordan, then ye shall stand in Jordan.
And Joshua said to the children of Israel, Come hither, and hearken to the word of the Lord our God.
Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and will utterly destroy from before our face the Chananite, and the Chettite and Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Amorite, and the Gergesite, and the Jebusite.
Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over Jordan.
Choose for yourselves twelve men of the sons of Israel, one of each tribe.
And it shall come to pass, when the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord of the whole earth rest in the water of Jordan, the water of Jordan below shall fail, and the water coming down from above shall stop.
And the people removed from their tents to cross over Jordan, and the priests bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord before the people.
And when the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord entered upon Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bore the ark of the covenant of the Lord were dipped in part of the water of Jordan; (now Jordan overflowed all its banks about the time of wheat harvest:)
then the waters that came down from above stopped; there stood one solid heap very far off, as far as the region of Kariathiarim, and the lower part came down to the sea of Araba, the salt sea, till it completely failed; and the people stood opposite Jericho.
And there was a transgressor so called there, and his name was Sabee, a Benjamite, the son of Bochori: and he blew the trumpet, and said, We have no portion in David, neither have we any inheritance in the son of Jessae: to thy tents, O Israel, every one.
And all the men of Israel went up from following David after Sabee the son of Bochori: but the men of Juda adhered to their king, from Jordan even to Jerusalem.
And David went into his house at Jerusalem: and the king took the ten women his concubines, whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them in a place of custody, and maintained them, and went not in to them; and they were kept living as widows, till the day of their death.
And the king said to Amessai, Call to me the men of Juda for three days, and do thou be present here.
And Amessai went to call Juda, and delayed beyond the time which David appointed him.
And David said to Amessai, Now shall Sabee the son of Bochori do us more harm than Abessalom: now then take thou with thee the servants of thy lord, and follow after him, lest he find for himself strong cities, so will he blind our eyes.
And there went out after him Amessai and the men of Joab, and the Cherethites, and the Phelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
And they were by the great stone that is in Gabaon: and Amessai went in before them: and Joab had upon him a military cloak over his apparel, and over it he was girded with a dagger fastened upon his loins in its scabbard: and the dagger came out, it even came out and fell.
And Joab said to Amessai, Art thou in health, my brother? and the right hand of Joab took hold of the beard of Amessai to kiss him.
And Amessai observed not the dagger that was in the hand of Joab: and Joab smote him with it on the loins, and his bowels were shed out upon the ground, and he did not repeat the blow, and he died: and Joab and Abessai his brother pursued after Sabee the son of Bochori.
And there stood over him one of the servants of Joab, and said, Who is he that is for Joab, and who is on the side of David following Joab?
And Amessai was weltering in blood in the midst of the way. And a man saw that all the people stood still; and he removed Amessai out of the path into a field, and he cast a garment upon him, because he saw every one that came to him standing still.
And when he was quickly removed from the road, every man of Israel passed after Joab to pursue after Sabee the son of Bochori.
And he went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, and to Bethmacha; and all in Charri too were assembled, and followed after him.
And they came and besieged him in Abel and Phermacha: and they raised a mound against the city and it stood close to the wall; and all the people with Joab proposed to throw down the wall.
And a wise woman cried from the wall, and said, Hear, hear; say, I pray ye, to Joab, Draw near hither, and I will speak to him.
And he drew nigh to her, and the woman said to him, Art thou Joab? and he said, I am. And she said to him, Hear the words of thy handmaid; and Joab said, I do hear.
And she spoke, saying, Of old time they said thus, Surely one was asked in Abel, and Dan, whether the faithful in Israel failed in what they purposed; they will surely ask in Abel, even in like manner, whether they have failed.
I am a peaceable one of the strong ones in Israel; but thou seekest to destroy a city and a mother city in Israel: why dost thou seek to ruin the inheritance of the Lord?
And Joab answered and said, Far be it, far be it from me, that I should ruin or destroy.
Is not the case thus, that a man of mount Ephraim, Sabee, son of Bochori by name, has even lifted up his hand against king David? Give him only to me, and I will depart from the city. And the woman said to Joab, Behold, his head shall be thrown to thee over the wall.
And the woman went in to all the people, and she spoke to all the city in her wisdom; and they took off the head of Sabee the son of Bochori; and took it away and threw it to Joab: and he blew the trumpet, and the people separated from the city away from him, every man to his tent: and Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king.
And Joab was over all the forces of Israel: and Banaias the son of Jodae was over the Cherethites and over the Phelethites.
And Adoniram was over the tribute: and Josaphath the son of Achiluth was recorder.
And Susa was scribe: and Sadoc and Abiathar were priests.
Moreover Iras the son of Iarin was priest to David.
And hide them together in the earth; and fill their faces with shame.
Then will I confess that thy right hand can save thee.
But now look at the wild beasts with thee; they eat grass like oxen.
Behold now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
He sets up his tail like a cypress; and his nerves are wrapped together.
His sides are sides of brass; and his backbone is as cast iron.
This is the chief of the creation of the Lord; made to be played with by his angels.
And when he has gone up to a steep mountain, he causes joy to the quadrupeds in the deep.
He lies under trees of every kind, by the papyrus, and reed, and bulrush.
And the great trees make a shadow over him with their branches, and so do the bushes of the field.
If there should be a flood, he will not perceive it; he trust that Jordan will rush up into his mouth.
But wilt thou catch the serpent with a hook, and put a halter about his nose?
Or wilt thou fasten a ring in his nostril, and bore his lip with a clasp?
Will he address thee with a petition? softly, with the voice of a suppliant?
And will he make a covenant with thee? and wilt thou take him for a perpetual servant?
And wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or bind him as a sparrow for a child?
And do the nations feed upon him, and the nations of the Phoenicians share him?
And all the ships come together would not be able to bear the mere skin of his tail; neither shall they carry his head in fishing-vessels.
But thou shalt lay thy hand upon him once, remembering the war that is waged by his mouth; and let it not be done any more.
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, in his holy mountain.
The city of the great King is well planted on the mountains of Sion, with the joy of the whole earth, on the sides of the north.
God is known in her palaces, when he undertakes to help her.
For, behold the kings of the earth were assembled, they came together.
They saw, and so they wondered: they were troubled, they were moved.
Trembling took hold on them: there were the pangs as of a woman in travail.
Thou wilt break the ships of Tharsis with a vehement wind.
As we have heard, so have we also seen, in the city of the Lord of hosts, in the city of our God: God has founded it for ever. Pause.
We have thought of thy mercy, O God, in the midst of thy people.
According to thy name, O God, so is also thy praise to the ends of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
Let mount Sion rejoice, let the daughters of Judaea exult, because of thy judgments, O Lord.
Go round about Sion, and encompass her: tell ye her towers.
Mark ye well her strength, and observe her palaces; that ye may tell the next generation.
For this is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guide for evermore.
Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his praises:
who forgives all thy transgressions, who heals all thy diseases;
who redeems thy life from corruption; who crowns thee with mercy and compassion;
who satisfies thy desire with good things: so that thy youth shall be renewed like that of the eagle.
The Lord executes mercy and judgment for all that are injured.
He made known his ways to Moses, his will to the children of Israel.
The Lord is compassionate and pitiful, long-suffering, and full of mercy.
He will not be always angry; neither will he be wrathful for ever.
He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor recompensed us according to our iniquities.
For as the heaven is high above the earth, the Lord has so increased his mercy toward them that fear him.
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us.
As a father pities his children, the Lord pities them that fear him.
For he knows our frame: remember that we are dust.
As for man, his days are as grass; as a flower of the field, so shall he flourish.
For the wind passes over it, and it shall not be; and it shall know its place no more.
But the mercy of the Lord is from generation to generation upon them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;
to them that keep his covenant, and remember his commandments to do them.
The Lord has prepared his throne in the heaven; and his kingdom rules over all.
Bless the Lord, all ye his angels, mighty in strength, who perform his bidding, ready to hearken to the voice of his words.
Bless the Lord, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his that do his will.
Bless the Lord, all his works, in every place of his dominion: bless the Lord, O my soul.
And it came to pass, when king Ezekias heard it, that he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and went up to the house of the Lord.
And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias,
To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing woman, but she has not strength to bring forth.
May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left.
So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias.
And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me,
Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.
So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis.
And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying,
Thus shall ye say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered?
Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath?
Where are the kings of Emath? and where is the king of Arphath? and where is the king of the city of Eppharuaim, and of Anagugana?
And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord.
And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying,
O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth.
Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God.
For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof,
and have cast their idols into the fire: for, they were no gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away.
But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that thou art God alone.
And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians.
This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee.
Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel?
For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers; for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region:
and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water.
Hast thou not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed them from ancient times; but now have I manifested my purpose of desolating nations in their strong holds, and them that dwell in strong cities.
I weakened their hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the house-tops, and as grass.
But now I know thy rest, and thy going out, and thy coming in.
And thy wrath wherewith thou hast been enraged, and thy rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in thy nose, and a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest.
And this shall be a sign to thee, Eat this year what thou hast sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward:
for out of Jerusalem there shall be a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it.
But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus saith the Lord.
I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David's sake.
And the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all these bodies dead.
And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve.
And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country's god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead.
And these are the words of the book, which Baruch the son of Nerias, the son of Maasias, the son of Sedecias, the son of Asadias, the son of Chelcias, wrote in Babylon,
In the fifth year, and in the seventh day of the month, what time as the Chaldeans took Jerusalem, and burnt it with fire.
And Baruch did read the words of this book in the hearing of Jechonias the son of Joachim king of Juda, and in the ears of all the people that came to hear the book,
And in the hearing of the nobles, and of the king's sons, and in the hearing of the elders, and of all the people, from the lowest unto the highest, even of all them that dwelt at Babylon by the river Sud.
Whereupon they wept, fasted, and prayed before the Lord.
They made also a collection of money according to every man's power:
And they sent it to Jerusalem unto Joachim the high priest, the son of Chelcias, son of Salom, and to the priests, and to all the people which were found with him at Jerusalem,
At the same time when he received the vessels of the house of the Lord, that were carried out of the temple, to return them into the land of Juda, the tenth day of the month Sivan, namely, silver vessels, which Sedecias the son of Josias king of Jada had made,
After that Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon had carried away Jechonias, and the princes, and the captives, and the mighty men, and the people of the land, from Jerusalem, and brought them unto Babylon.
And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;
And pray for the life of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and for the life of Balthasar his son, that their days may be upon earth as the days of heaven:
And the Lord will give us strength, and lighten our eyes, and we shall live under the shadow of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and under the shadow of Balthasar his son, and we shall serve them many days, and find favour in their sight.
Pray for us also unto the Lord our God, for we have sinned against the Lord our God; and unto this day the fury of the Lord and his wrath is not turned from us.
And ye shall read this book which we have sent unto you, to make confession in the house of the Lord, upon the feasts and solemn days.
And ye shall say, To the Lord our God belongeth righteousness, but unto us the confusion of faces, as it is come to pass this day, unto them of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,
And to our kings, and to our princes, and to our priests, and to our prophets, and to our fathers:
For we have sinned before the Lord,
And disobeyed him, and have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in the commandments that he gave us openly:
Since the day that the Lord brought our forefathers out of the land of Egypt, unto this present day, we have been disobedient unto the Lord our God, and we have been negligent in not hearing his voice.
Wherefore the evils cleaved unto us, and the curse, which the Lord appointed by Moses his servant at the time that he brought our fathers out of the land of Egypt, to give us a land that floweth with milk and honey, like as it is to see this day.
Nevertheless we have not hearkened unto the voice of the Lord our God, according unto all the words of the prophets, whom he sent unto us:
But every man followed the imagination of his own wicked heart, to serve strange gods, and to do evil in the sight of the Lord our God.
And he was attached to the soul of Dina the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the damsel, and he spoke kindly to the damsel.
Sychem spoke to Emmor his father, saying, Take for me this damsel to wife.
And Jacob heard that the son of Emmor had defiled Dina his daughter (now his sons were with his cattle in the plain). And Jacob was silent until they came.
And Emmor the father of Sychem went forth to Jacob, to speak to him.
and intermarry with us. Give us your daughters, and take our daughters for your sons.
And dwell in the midst of us; and, behold, the land is spacious before you, dwell in it, and trade, and get possessions in it.
And Sychem said to her father and to her brothers, I would find grace before you, and we will give whatever ye shall name.
And all that went in at the gate of their city hearkened to Emmor and Sychem his son, and they were circumcised in the flesh of their foreskin every male.
And it came to pass on the third day, when they were in pain, the two sons of Jacob, Symeon and Levi, Dina's brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city securely, and slew every male.
And they slew Emmor and Sychem his son with the edge of the sword, and took Dina out of the house of Sychem, and went forth.
And Jacob said to Symeon and Levi, Ye have made me hateful so that I should be evil to all the inhabitants of the land, both among the Chananites and the Pherezites, and I am few in number; they will gather themselves against me and cut me in pieces, and I shall be utterly destroyed, and my house.
And they said, Nay, but shall they treat our sister as an harlot?
And the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,
Let the children of Israel encamp fronting each other, every man keeping his own rank, according to their standards, according to the houses of their families; the children of Israel shall encamp round about the tabernacle of witness.
And they that encamp first toward the east shall be the order of the camp of Juda with their host, and the prince of the sons of Juda, Naasson the son of Aminadab.
His forces that were numbered, were seventy-four thousand and six hundred.
And they that encamp next shall be of the tribe of Issachar, and the prince of the sons of Issachar shall be Nathanael the son of Sogar.
His forces that were numbered, were fifty-four thousand and four hundred.
And they that encamp next shall be of the tribe of Zabulon, and the prince of the sons of Zabulon shall be Eliab the son of Chaelon.
His forces that were numbered, were fifty-seven thousand and four hundred.
All that were numbered of the camp of Juda were a hundred and eighty thousand and six thousand and four hundred: they shall move first with their forces.
This is the order of the camp of Ruben; their forces shall be toward the south, and the prince of the children of Ruben shall be Elisur the son of Sediur.
His forces that were numbered, were forty-six thousand and five hundred.
And they that encamp next to him shall be of the tribe of Symeon, and the prince of the sons of Symeon shall be Salamiel the son of Surisadai.
His forces that were numbered, were fifty-nine thousand and three hundred.
And they that encamp next to them shall be the tribe of Gad; and the prince of the sons of Gad, Elisaph the son of Raguel.
His forces that were numbered, were forty-five thousand and six hundred and fifty.
All who were numbered of the camp of Ruben, were a hundred and fifty-one thousand and four hundred and fifty: they with their forces shall proceed in the second place.
And then the tabernacle of witness shall be set forward, and the camp of the Levites shall be between the camps; as they shall encamp, so also shall they commence their march, each one next in order to his fellow according to their companies.
The station of the camp of Ephraim shall be westward with their forces, and the head of the children of Ephraim shall be Elisama the son of Emiud.
His forces that were numbered, are forty thousand and five hundred.
And they that encamp next shall be of the tribe of Manasse, and the prince of the sons of Manasse, Gamaliel the son of Phadassur.
His forces that were numbered, were thirty-two thousand and two hundred.
And they that encamp next shall be of the tribe of Benjamin, and the prince of the sons of Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gadeoni.
His forces that were numbered, were thirty-five thousand and four hundred.
All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim, were one hundred and eight thousand and one hundred: they with their forces shall set out third.
The order of the camp of Dan shall be northward with their forces; and the prince of the sons of Dan, Achiezer the son of Amisadai.
His forces that were numbered, were sixty-two thousand and seven hundred.
And they that encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Aser; and the prince of the sons of Aser, Phagiel the son of Echran.
His forces that were numbered, were forty-one thousand and five hundred.
And they that encamp next shall be of the tribe of Nephthali; and the prince of the children of Nephthali, Achire son Aenan.
His forces that were numbered were fifty-three thousand and four hundred.
All that were numbered of the camp of Dan, were a hundred and fifty-seven thousand and six hundred: they shall set out last according to their order.
This is the numbering of the children of Israel according to the houses of their families: all the numbering of the camps with their forces, was six hundred and three thousand, five hundred and fifty.
But the Levites were not numbered with them, as the Lord commanded Moses.
And the children of Israel did all things that the Lord commanded Moses; thus they encamped in their order, and thus they began their march in succession each according to their divisions, according to the houses of their families.
In the Lord I have put my trust: how will ye say to my soul,
Flee to the mountains as a sparrow?
For behold the sinners have bent their bow, they have prepared their arrows for the quiver, to shoot For privily at the upright in heart.
For they have pulled down what thou didst frame, but what has the righteous done?
The Lord is in his holy temple, as for the Lord, his throne is in heaven: his eyes look upon the poor, his eyelids try the sons of men.
The Lord tries the righteous and the ungodly: and he that loves unrighteousness hates his own soul.
And Samuel said to Saul, The Lord sent me to anoint thee king over Israel: and now hear the voice of the Lord.
Thus said the Lord of hosts, Now will I take vengeance for what Amalec did to Israel, when he met him in the way as he came up out of Egypt.
And now go, and thou shalt smite Amalec and Hierim and all that belongs to him, and thou shalt not save anything of him alive, but thou shalt utterly destroy him: and thou shalt devote him and all his to destruction, and thou shalt spare nothing belonging to him; and thou shalt slay both man and woman, and infant and suckling, and calf and sheep, and camel and ass.
And Saul summoned the people, and he numbered them in Galgala, four hundred thousand regular troops, and Juda thirty thousand regular troops.
And Saul came to the cities of Amalec, and laid wait in the valley.
And Saul said to the Kinite, Go, and depart out of the midst of the Amalekites, lest I put thee with them; for thou dealedst mercifully with the children of Israel when they went up out of Egypt. So the Kinite departed from the midst of Amalec.
And Saul smote Amalec from Evilat to Sur fronting Egypt.
And he took Agag the king of Amalec alive, and he slew all the people and Hierim with the edge of the sword.
And Saul and all the people saved Agag alive, and the best of the flocks, and of the herds, and of the fruits, of the vineyards, and of all the good things; and they would not destroy them: but every worthless and refuse thing they destroyed.
And the word of the Lord came to Samuel, saying,
I have repented that I have made Saul to be king: for he has turned back from following me, and has not kept my word. And Samuel was grieved, and cried to the Lord all night.
And Samuel rose early and went to meet Israel in the morning, and it was told Saul, saying, Samuel has come to Carmel, and he has raised up help for himself: and he turned his chariot, and came down to Galgala to Saul; and, behold, he was offering up a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord, the chief of the spoils which he brought out of Amalec.
And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said to him, Blessed art thou of the Lord: I have performed all that the Lord said.
And Samuel said, What then is the bleating of this flock in my ears, and the sound of the oxen which I hear?
And Saul said, I have brought them out of Amalec, that which the people preserved, even the best of the sheep, and of the cattle, that it might be sacrificed to the Lord thy God, and the rest have I utterly destroyed.
And Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the Lord has said to me this night: and he said to him, Say on.
And Samuel said to Saul, Art thou not little in his eyes, though a leader of one of the tribes of Israel? and yet the Lord anointed thee to be king over Israel.
And the Lord sent thee on a journey, and said to thee, Go, and utterly destroy: thou shalt slay the sinners against me, even the Amalekites; and thou shalt war against them until thou have consumed them.
And why didst not thou hearken to the voice of the Lord, but didst haste to fasten upon the spoils, and didst that which was evil in the sight of the Lord?
And Saul said to Samuel, Because I listened to the voice of the people: yet I went the way by which the Lord sent me, and I brought Agag the king of Amalec, and I destroyed Amalec.
But the people took of the spoils the best flocks and herds out of that which was destroyed, to sacrifice before the Lord our God in Galgal.
And Samuel said, Does the Lord take pleasure in whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in hearing the words of the Lord? behold, obedience is better than a good sacrifice, and hearkening than the fat of rams.
For sin is as divination; idols bring on pain and grief. Because thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord also shall reject thee from being king over Israel.
And Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned, in that I have transgressed the word of the Lord and thy direction; for I feared the people, and I hearkened to their voice.
And now remove, I pray thee, my sin, and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.
And Samuel said to Saul, I will not turn back with thee, for thou hast rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord will reject thee from being king over Israel.
And Samuel turned his face to depart, and Saul caught hold of the skirt of his garment, and tore it.
And Samuel said to him, The Lord has rent thy kingdom from Israel out of thy hand this day, and will give it to thy neighbour who is better than thou.
And Israel shall be divided to two: and God will not turn nor repent, for he is not as a man to repent.
And Saul said, I have sinned; yet honour me, I pray thee, before the elders of Israel, and before my people; and turn back with me, and I will worship the Lord thy God.
So Samuel turned back after Saul, and he worshipped the Lord.
And Samuel said, Bring me Agag the king of Amalec: and Agag came to him trembling; and Agag said Is death thus bitter?
And Samuel said to Agag, As thy sword has bereaved women of their children, so shall thy mother be made childless among women: and Samuel slew Agag before the Lord in Galgal.
And Samuel departed to Armathaim, and Saul went up to his house at Gabaa.
And Samuel did not see Saul again till the day of his death, for Samuel mourned after Saul, and the Lord repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.
I perish, carried away by the wind, and I seek for burial, and obtain it not.
Weary I intreat; and what have I done? and strangers have stolen my goods.
Who is this? let him join hands with me.
He shall promise mischief to his companions: but their eyes have failed for their children.
But thou has made me a byword amount the nations, and I am become a scorn to them.
For my eyes are dimmed through pain; I have been grievously beset by all.
Wonder has seized true men upon this; and let the just rise up against the transgressor.
But let the faithful hold on his own way, and let him that is pure of hands take courage.
Howbeit, do ye all strengthen yourselves and come now, for I do not find truth in you.
My days have passed in groaning, and my heart-strings are broken.
For if I remain, Hades is my habitation: and my bed has been made in darkness.
I have called upon death to be my father, and corruption to be my mother and sister.
Where then is yet my hope? or where shall I see my good?
Will they go down with me to Hades, or shall we go down together to the tomb?
Be enlightened, be enlightened, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee.
Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and there shall be gross darkness on the nations: but the Lord shall appear upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee.
And kings shall walk in thy light, and nations in thy brightness.
Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold thy children gathered: all thy sons have come from far, and thy daughters shall be borne on men's shoulders.
Then shalt thou see, and fear, and be amazed in thine heart; for the wealth of the sea shall come round to thee, and of nations and peoples; and herds of camels shall come to thee,
and the camels of Madiam and Gaepha shall cover thee: all from Saba shall come bearing gold, and shall bring frankincense, and they shall publish the salvation of the Lord.
And all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered, and the rams of Nabaeoth shall come; and acceptable sacrifices shall be offered on my altar, and my house of prayer shall be glorified.
Who are these that fly as clouds, and as doves with young ones to me?
The isles have waited for me, and the ships of Tharsis among the first, to bring thy children from afar, and their silver and their gold with them, and that for the sake of the holy name of the Lord, and because the Holy One of Israel is glorified.
And strangers shall build thy walls, and their kings shall wait upon thee: for by reason of my wrath I smote thee, and by reason of mercy I loved thee.
And thy gates shall be opened continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; to bring in to thee the power of the Gentiles, and their kings as captives.
For the nations and the kings which will not serve thee shall perish; and those nations shall be made utterly desolate.
And the glory of Libanus shall come to thee, with the cypress, and pine, and cedar together, to glorify my holy place.
And the sons of them that afflicted thee, and of them that provoked thee, shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called Sion, the city of the Holy One of Israel.
Because thou has become desolate and hated, and there was no helper, therefore I will make thee a perpetual gladness, a joy of many generations.
And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt eat the wealth of kings: and shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and delivers thee, the Holy One of Israel.
And for brass I will bring thee gold, and for iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of wood I will bring thee brass, and instead of stones, iron; and I will make thy princes peaceable, and thine overseers righteous.
And injustice shall no more be heard in thy land, nor destruction nor misery in thy coasts; but thy walls shall be called Salvation, and thy gates Sculptured Work.
And thou shalt no more have the sun for a light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon lighten thy night; but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and God thy glory.
For the sun shall no more set, nor shall the moon be eclipsed; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be completed.
Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, preserving that which they have planted, even the works of their hands, for glory.
The little one shall become thousands, and the least a great nation; I the Lord will gather them in due time.
And if a woman have an issue of blood many days, not in the time of her separation; if the blood should also flow after her separation, all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.
And every bed on which she shall lie all the days of her flux shall be to her as the bed of her separation, and every seat whereon she shall sit shall be unclean according to the uncleanness of her separation.
Every one that touches it shall be unclean; and he shall wash his garments, and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean till evening.
But if she shall be cleansed from her flux, then she shall number to herself seven days, and afterwards she shall be esteemed clean.
And on the eighth day she shall take two turtle-doves, or two young pigeons, and shall bring them to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of witness.
And the priest shall offer one for a sin-offering, and the other for a whole-burnt-offering, and the priest shall make atonement for her before the Lord for her unclean flux.
And ye shall cause the children of Israel to beware of their uncleannesses; so they shall not die for their uncleanness, in polluting my tabernacle that is among them.
This is the law of the man who has an issue, and if one discharge seed of copulation, so that he should be polluted by it.
And this is the law for her that has the issue of blood in her separation, and as to the person who has an issue of seed, in his issue: it is a law for the male and the female, and for the man who shall have lain with her that is set apart.
And the men of Ephraim said to Gedeon, What is this that thou hast done to us, in that thou didst not call us when thou wentest to fight with Madiam? and they chode with him sharply.
And he said to them, What have I now done in comparison of you? is not the gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?
The Lord has delivered into your hand the princes of Madiam, Oreb and Zeb; and what could I do in comparison of you? Then was their spirit calmed toward him, when he spoke this word.
And Gedeon came to Jordan, and went over, himself and the three hundred with him, hungry, yet pursuing.
And he said to the men of Socchoth, Give, I pray you, bread to feed this people that follow me; because they are faint, and behold, I am following after Zebee and Salmana, kings of Madiam.
And the princes of Socchoth said, Are the hands of Zebee and Salmana now in thy hand, that we should give bread to thy host?
And Gedeon said, Therefore when the Lord gives Zebee and Salmana into my hand, then will I tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness, and the Barkenim.
And he went up thence to Phanuel, and spoke to them likewise: and the men of Phanuel answered him as the men of Socchoth had answered him.
And Gedeon said to the men of Phanuel, When I return in peace, I will break down this tower.
And Zebee and Salmana were in Carcar, and their host was with them, about fifteen thousand, all that were left of all the host of the aliens; and they that fell were a hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword.
And he said to Jether his first-born, Rise and slay them; but the lad drew not his sword, for he was afraid, for he was yet very young.
And Zebee and Salmana said, Rise thou and fall upon us, for thy power is as that of a man; and Gedeon arose, and slew Zebee and Salmana: and he took the round ornaments that were on the necks of their camels.
And the men of Israel said to Gedeon, Rule, my lord, over us, both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son; for thou hast saved us out of the hand of Madiam.
And Gedeon said to them, I will not rule, and my son shall not rule among you; the Lord shall rule over you.
And Gedeon said to them, I will make a request of you, and do ye give me every man an earring out of his spoils: for they had golden earrings, for they were Ismaelites.
And they said, We will certainly give them: and he opened his garment, and each man cast therein an earring of his spoils.
And the weight of the golden earrings which he asked, was a thousand and seven hundred pieces of gold, besides the crescents, and the chains, and the garments, and the purple cloths that were on the kings of Madiam, and besides the chains that were on the necks of their camels.
And Gedeon made an ephod of it, an set it in his city in Ephratha; and all Israel went thither a whoring after it, and it became a stumbling-block to Gedeon and his house.
And Moses finished speaking all these words to all the children of Israel;
and said to them, I am this day a hundred and twenty years old; I shall not be able any longer to come in or go out; and the Lord said to me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.
The Lord thy God who goes before thee, he shall destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt inherit them: and it shall be Joshua that goes before thy face, as the Lord has spoken.
And the Lord has delivered them to you; and ye shall do to them, as I charged you.
Be courageous and strong, fear not, neither be cowardly neither be afraid before them; for it is the Lord your God that advances with you in the midst of you, neither will he by any means forsake thee, nor desert thee.
And Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Israel, Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt go in before this people into the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and thou shalt give it to them for an inheritance.
And the Lord that goes with thee shall not forsake thee nor abandon thee; fear not, neither be afraid.
And Moses wrote the words of this law in a book, and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to the elders of the sons of Israel.
And Moses charged them in that day, saying, After seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,
having assembled the people, the men, and the women, and the children, and the stranger that is in your cities, that they may hear, and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God; and they shall hearken to do all the words of this law.
And their sons who have not known shall hear, and shall learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days that they live upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it.
And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, the days of thy death are at hand; call Joshua, and stand ye by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and I will give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went to the tabernacle of testimony, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony.
And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will arise and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they are entering: and they will forsake me, and break my covenant, which I made with them.
And I will be very angry with them in that day, and I will leave them and turn my face away from them, and they shall be devoured; and many evils and afflictions shall come upon them; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils have come upon me.
And I will surely turn away my face from them in that day, because of all their evil doings which they have done, because they turned aside after strange gods.
And now write the words of this song, and teach it to the children of Israel, and ye shall put it into their mouth, that this song may witness for me among the children of Israel to their face.
For I will bring them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy themselves; then will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke me, and break my covenant.
And this song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers.
And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel.
And he charged Joshua, and said, Be courageous and strong, for thou shalt bring the sons of Israel into the land, which the Lord sware to them, and he shall be with thee.
And when Moses finished writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the end,
then he charged the Levites who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying,
Take the book of this law, and ye shall put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there among you for a testimony.
For I know thy provocation, and thy stiff neck; for yet during my life with you at this day, ye have been provoking in your conduct toward God: how shall ye not also be so after my death?
Gather together to me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, that I may speak in their ears all these words; and I call both heaven and earth to witness against them.
For I know that after my death ye will utterly transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and evils shall come upon you in the latter days, because ye will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands. And Moses spoke all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole assembly.
For I know that after my death ye will utterly transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and evils shall come upon you in the latter days, because ye will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands. And Moses spoke all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole assembly.
O Lord, thou has taken pleasure in thy land: thou hast turned back the captivity of Jacob.
Thou hast forgiven thy people their transgressions; thou has covered all their sins. Pause.
Thou has caused all thy wrath to cease: thou hast turned from thy fierce anger.
Turn us, O God of our salvation, and turn thy anger away from us.
Wouldest thou be angry with us for ever? or wilt thou continue thy wrath from generation to generation?
O God, thou wilt turn and quicken us; and thy people shall rejoice in thee.
Shew us thy mercy, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation.
I will hear what the Lord God will say concerning me: for he shall speak peace to his people, and to his saints, and to those that turn their heart toward him.
Moreover his salvation is near them that fear him; that glory may dwell in our land.
Mercy and truth are met together: righteousness and peace have kissed each other.
Truth has sprung out of the earth; and righteousness has looked down from heaven.
For the Lord will give goodness; and our land shall yield her fruit.
Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set his steps in the way.
The burden of Nineve: the book of the vision of Naum the Elkesite.
God is jealous, and the Lord avenges; the Lord avenges with wrath; the Lord takes vengeance on his adversaries, and he cuts off his enemies.
The Lord is long-suffering, and his power is great, and the Lord will not hold any guiltless: his way is in destruction and in the whirlwind, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.
He threatens the sea, and dries it up, and exhausts all the rivers: the land of Basan, and Carmel are brought low, and the flourishing trees of Libanus have come to nought.
The mountains quake at him, and the hills are shaken, and the earth recoils at his presence, even the world, and all that dwell in it.
Who shall stand before his anger? and who shall withstand in the anger of his wrath? his wrath brings to nought kingdoms, and the rocks are burst asunder by him.
The Lord is good to them that wait on him in the day of affliction; and he knows them that reverence him.
But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end: darkness shall pursue those that rise up against him and his enemies.
What do ye devise against the Lord? he will make a complete end: he will not take vengeance by affliction twice at the same time.
For the enemy shall be laid bare even to the foundation, and shall be devoured as twisted yew, and as stubble fully dry.
Out of thee shall proceed a device against the Lord, counselling evil things hostile to him.
Thus saith the Lord who rules over many waters, Even thus shall they be sent away, and the report of thee shall not be heard any more.
The Lord created man of the earth, and turned him into it again.
He gave them few days, and a short time, and power also over the things therein.
He endued them with strength by themselves, and made them according to his image,
And put the fear of man upon all flesh, and gave him dominion over beasts and fowls.
Counsel, and a tongue, and eyes, ears, and a heart, gave he them to understand.
Withal he filled them with the knowledge of understanding, and shewed them good and evil.
He set his eye upon their hearts, that he might shew them the greatness of his works.
He gave them to glory in his marvellous acts for ever, that they might declare his works with understanding.
And the elect shall praise his holy name.
Beside this he gave them knowledge, and the law of life for an heritage.
He made an everlasting covenant with them, and shewed them his judgments.
Their eyes saw the majesty of his glory, and their ears heard his glorious voice.
And he said unto them, Beware of all unrighteousness; and he gave every man commandment concerning his neighbour.
Their ways are ever before him, and shall not be hid from his eyes.
For in the division of the nations of the whole earth he set a ruler over every people; but Israel is the Lord's portion:
Therefore all their works are as the sun before him, and his eyes are continually upon their ways.
None of their unrighteous deeds are hid from him, but all their sins are before the Lord
The alms of a man is as a signet with him, and he will keep the good deeds of man as the apple of the eye, and give repentance to his sons and daughters.
Afterwards he will rise up and reward them, and render their recompence upon their heads.
But unto them that repent, he granted them return, and comforted those that failed in patience.
Return unto the Lord, and forsake thy sins, make thy prayer before his face, and offend less.
Turn again to the most High, and turn away from iniquity: for he will lead thee out of darkness into the light of health, and hate thou abomination vehemently.
Who shall praise the most High in the grave, instead of them which live and give thanks?
Thanksgiving perisheth from the dead, as from one that is not: the living and sound in heart shall praise the Lord.
How great is the lovingkindness of the Lord our God, and his compassion unto such as turn unto him in holiness!
For all things cannot be in men, because the son of man is not immortal.
What is brighter than the sun? yet the light thereof faileth; and flesh and blood will imagine evil.
He vieweth the power of the height of heaven; and all men are but earth and ashes.
Before I formed thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth from the womb, I sanctified thee; I appointed thee a prophet to the nations.
And the Lord stretched forth his hand to me, and touched my mouth: and the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words into thy mouth.
Behold, I have appointed thee this day over nations and over kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to rebuild, and to plant.
And the word of the Lord came to me, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A rod of an almond tree.
And the Lord said to me, Thou hast well seen: for I have watched over my words to perform them.
And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, A caldron on the fire; and the face of it is toward the north.
Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was in the midst of the captivity by the river of Chobar; and the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.
On the fifth day of the month; this was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joakim.
And the word of the Lord came to Jezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river of Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was upon me.
And I looked, and, behold, a sweeping wind came from the north, and a great cloud on it, and there was brightness round about it, and gleaming fire, and in the midst of it as it were the appearance of amber in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it.
And in the midst as it were the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; the likeness of a man was upon them.
And each one had four faces, and each one had four wings.
And their legs were straight; and their feet were winged, and there were sparks, like gleaming brass, and their wings were light.
And the hand of a man was under their wings on their four sides.
And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went everyone straight forward.
And the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face of an eagle to the four.
And I looked, and, behold, the four had each one wheel on the ground near the living creatures.
And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the earth, the wheels were lifted off.
Wherever the cloud happened to be, there was the spirit ready to go: the wheels went and were lifted up with them; because the spirit of life was in the wheels.
When those went, the wheels went; and when those stood, the wheels stood; and when those lifted themselves off the earth, they were lifted off with them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels.
And the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread out over their wings above.
And lo! a voice from above the firmament
And I will say to them, If it be good in your eyes, give me my price, or refuse it. And they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver.
And the Lord said to me, Drop them into the furnace, and I will see if it is good metal, as I was proved for their sakes. And I took the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the furnace in the house of the Lord.
And God appeared to him by the oak of Mambre, as he sat by the door of his tent at noon.
And he lifted up his eyes and beheld, and lo! three men stood before him; and having seen them he ran to meet them from the door of his tent, and did obeisance to the ground.
And Abraam hasted to the tent to Sarrha, and said to her, Hasten, and knead three measures of fine flour, and make cakes.
And Abraam ran to the kine, and took a young calf, tender and good, and gave it to his servant, and he hasted to dress it.
And he took butter and milk, and the calf which he had dressed; and he set them before them, and they did eat, and he stood by them under the tree.
And he said to him, Where is Sarrha thy wife? And he answered and said, Behold! in the tent.
But Abraam shall become a great and populous nation, and in him shall all the nations of the earth be blest.
For I know that he will order his sons, and his house after him, and they will keep the ways of the Lord, to do justice and judgment, that the Lord may bring upon Abraam all things whatsoever he has spoken to him.
And the Lord said, The cry of Sodom and Gomorrha has been increased towards me, and their sins are very great.
I will therefore go down and see, if they completely correspond with the cry which comes to me, and if not, that I may know.
And Abraam drew nigh and said, Wouldest thou destroy the righteous with the wicked, and shall the righteous be as the wicked?
Should there be fifty righteous in the city, wilt thou destroy them? wilt thou not spare the whole place for the sake of the fifty righteous, if they be in it?
By no means shalt thou do as this thing so as to destroy the righteous with the wicked, so the righteous shall be as the wicked: by no means. Thou that judgest the whole earth, shalt thou not do right?
And the Lord said, If there should be in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole city, and the whole place for their sakes.
And Abraam answered and said, Now I have begun to speak to my Lord, and I am earth and ashes.
But if the fifty righteous should be diminished to forty-five, wilt thou destroy the whole city because of the five ? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there forty-five.
And he said, Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there should be found there twenty? And he said, I will not destroy it, if I should find there twenty.
And he said, Will there be anything , Lord, if I speak yet once? but if there should be found there ten? And he said, I will not destroy it for the ten's sake.
And it came to pass in the fourth year of Darius the king, that the word of the Lord came to Zacharias on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chaseleu.
All the works of the humble man are manifest with God; but the ungodly shall perish in an evil day.
Every one that is proud in heart is unclean before God, and he that unjustly strikes hands with hand shall not be held guiltless. The beginning of a good way is to do justly; and it is more acceptable with God than to offer sacrifices. He that seeks the Lord shall find knowledge with righteousness: and they that rightly seek him shall find peace. All of the works of the Lord are done with righteousness; and the ungodly man is kept for the evil day.
There is an oracle upon the lips of a king; and his mouth shall not err in judgment.
The poise of the balance is righteousness with the Lord; and his works are righteous measures.
An evil-doer is an abomination to a king; for the throne of rule is established by righteousness.
Righteous lips are acceptable to a king; and he loves right words.
The anger of a king is a messenger of death; but a wise man will pacify him.
The son of a king is in the light of life; and they that are in favour with him are as a cloud of latter rain.
The brood of wisdom is more to be chosen than gold, and the brood of prudence more to be chosen than silver.
The paths of life turn aside from evil; and the ways of righteousness are length of life. He that receives instruction shall be in prosperity; and he that regards reproofs shall be made wise. He that keeps his ways, preserves his own soul; and he that loves his life will spare his mouth.
Pride goes before destruction, and folly before a fall.
Better is a meek-spirited man with lowliness, than one who divides spoils with the proud.
He who is skillful in business finds good: but he that trusts in God is most blessed.
Men call the wise and understanding evil: but they that are pleasing in speech shall hear more.
Understanding is a fountain of life to its possessors; but the instruction of fools is evil.
The heart of the wise will discern the things which proceed from his own mouth; and on his lips he will wear knowledge.
Good words are honeycombs, and the sweetness thereof is a healing of the soul.
There are ways that seem to be right to a man, but the end of them looks to the depth of hell.
A man who labours, labours for himself, and drives from him his own ruin.
But the perverse bears destruction upon his own mouth: a foolish man digs up evil for himself, and treasures fire on his own lips.
A perverse man spreads mischief, and will kindle a torch of deceit with mischiefs; and he separates friends.
A transgressor tries to ensnare friends, and leads them in ways that are not good.
And the man that fixes his eyes devises perverse things, and marks out with his lips all evil: he is a furnace of wickedness.
Old age is a crown of honour, but it is found in the ways of righteousness.
A man slow to anger is better than a strong man; and he that governs his temper better than he that takes a city.
All evils come upon the ungodly into their bosoms; but all righteous things come of the Lord.
Cry to me, and I will answer thee, and I will declare to thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.
For thus saith the Lord concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the king of Juda, which have been pulled down for mounds and fortifications,
to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill it with the corpses of men, whom I smote in mine anger and my wrath, and turned away my face from them, for all their wickedness:
Behold, I bring upon her healing and cure, and I will show myself to them, and will heal her, and make both peace and security.
And I will turn the captivity of Juda, and the captivity of Israel, and will build them, even as before.
And I will cleanse them from all their iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and will not remember their sins, whereby they have sinned against me, and revolted from me.
And it shall be for joy and praise, and for glory to all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I will do: and they shall fear and be provoked for all the good things and for all the peace which I will bring upon them.
Thus saith the Lord; There shall yet be heard in this place, of which ye say, it is destitute of men and cattle, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, the places that have been made desolate for want of men and cattle,
the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of men saying, Give thanks to the Lord Almighty: for the Lord is good; for his mercy endures fore ever: and they shall bring gifts into the house of the Lord; for I will turn all the captivity of that land as before, said the Lord.
Thus saith the Lord of hosts; There shall yet be in this place, that is desert for want of man and beast, in all the cities thereof, resting-places for shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.
In the cities of the hill country, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the cities round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, flocks shall yet pass under the hand of him that numbers them, saith the Lord.
O Lord, thou hast proved me, and known me.
Thou knowest my down-sitting and mine up-rising: thou understandest my thoughts long before.
Thou hast traced my path and my bed, and hast foreseen all my ways.
For there is no unrighteous word in my tongue: behold, O Lord, thou hast known all things,
the last and the first: thou hast fashioned me, and laid thine hand upon me.
The knowledge of thee is too wonderful for me; it is very difficult, I cannot attain to it.
Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? and whither shall I flee from my presence?
If I should go up to heaven, thou art there: if I should go down to hell, thou art present.
If I should spread my wings to fly straight forward, and sojourn at the extremity of the sea, it would be vain,
for even there thy hand would guide me, and thy right hand would hold me.
When I said, Surely the darkness will cover me; even the night was light in my luxury.
For darkness will not be darkness with thee; but night will be light as day: as its darkness, so shall its light be to thee.
For thou, O Lord, hast possessed my reins; thou hast helped me from my mother's womb.
I will give thee thanks; for thou art fearfully wondrous; wondrous are thy works; and my soul knows it well.
My bones, which thou madest in secret were not hidden from thee, nor my substance, in the lowest parts of the earth.
Thine eyes saw my unwrought substance, and all men shall be written in thy book; they shall be formed by day, though there should for a time be no one among them.
But thy friends, O God, have been greatly honoured by me; their rule has been greatly strengthened.
I will number them, and they shall be multiplied beyond the sand; I awake, and am still with thee.
Oh that thou wouldest slay the wicked, O God; depart from me, ye men of blood.
For thou wilt say concerning their thought, that they shall take thy cities in vain.
Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hate thee? and wasted away because of thine enemies?
I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were counted my enemies.
Prove me, O God, and know my heart; examine me, and know my paths;
and see if there is any way of iniquity in me, and lead me in an everlasting way.
The Lord reigns; he has clothed himself with honour: the Lord has clothed and girded himself with strength; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved.
Thy throne is prepared of old: thou art from everlasting.
The rivers have lifted up, O Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices,
at the voices of many waters: the billows of the sea are wonderful: the Lord is wonderful in high places.
Thy testimonies are made very sure: holiness becomes thine house, O Lord, for ever.
And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded, saying, Keep all these commands, all that I command you this day.
And it shall come to pass in the day when ye shall cross over Jordan into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, that thou shalt set up for thyself great stones, and shalt plaster them with plaster.
And he shall be as the wild tamarisk in the desert: he shall not see when good comes; but he shall dwell in barren places, and in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not inhabited.
But blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord shall be.
And he shall be as a thriving tree by the waters, and he shall cast forth his root toward a moist place: he shall not fear when heat comes, and there shall be upon him shady branches: he shall not fear in a year of drought, and he shall not fail to bear fruit.
The heart is deep beyond all things, and it is the man, and who can know him?
I the Lord try the hearts, and prove the reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruits of his devices.
The partridge utters her voice, she gathers eggs which she did not lay; so is a man gaining his wealth unjustly; in the midst of his days his riches shall leave him, and at his latter end he will be a fool.
Thus saith the Lord; Go and stand in the gates of the children of thy people, by which the kings of Juda enter, and by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem:
and thou shalt say to them, Hear the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and all Judea, and all Jerusalem, all who go in at these gates:
thus saith the Lord; Take heed to your souls, and take up no burdens on the sabbath-day, and go not forth through the gates of Jerusalem;
and carry forth no burdens out of your houses on the sabbath-day, and ye shall do no work: sanctify the sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers.
But they hearkened not, and inclined not their ear, but stiffened their neck more than their fathers did, so as not to hear me, and not to receive correction.
And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken to me, saith the Lord, to carry in no burdens through the gates of this city on the sabbath-day, and to sanctify the sabbath-day, so as to do no work upon it,
that there shall enter through the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, and riding on their chariots and horses, they, and their princes, the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.
All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever.
Who can number the sand of the sea, and the drops of rain, and the days of eternity?
Who can find out the height of heaven, and the breadth of the earth, and the deep, and wisdom?
Wisdom hath been created before all things, and the understanding of prudence from everlasting.
The word of God most high is the fountain of wisdom; and her ways are everlasting commandments.
To whom hath the root of wisdom been revealed? or who hath known her wise counsels?
Unto whom hath the knowledge of wisdom been made manifest? and who hath understood her great experience?
There is one wise and greatly to be feared, the Lord sitting upon his throne.
He created her, and saw her, and numbered her, and poured her out upon all his works.
She is with all flesh according to his gift, and he hath given her to them that love him.
The fear of the Lord is honour, and glory, and gladness, and a crown of rejoicing.
The fear of the Lord maketh a merry heart, and giveth joy, and gladness, and a long life.
Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last, and he shall find favour in the day of his death.
To fear the Lord is the beginning of wisdom: and it was created with the faithful in the womb.
She hath built an everlasting foundation with men, and she shall continue with their seed.
To fear the Lord is fulness of wisdom, and filleth men with her fruits.
She filleth all their house with things desirable, and the garners with her increase.
The fear of the Lord is a crown of wisdom, making peace and perfect health to flourish; both which are the gifts of God: and it enlargeth their rejoicing that love him.
Wisdom raineth down skill and knowledge of understanding standing, and exalteth them to honour that hold her fast.
The root of wisdom is to fear the Lord, and the branches thereof are long life.
The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.
A furious man cannot be justified; for the sway of his fury shall be his destruction.
A patient man will tear for a time, and afterward joy shall spring up unto him.
He will hide his words for a time, and the lips of many shall declare his wisdom.
The parables of knowledge are in the treasures of wisdom: but godliness is an abomination to a sinner.
If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.
For the fear of the Lord is wisdom and instruction: and faith and meekness are his delight.
Distrust not the fear of the Lord when thou art poor: and come not unto him with a double heart.
Be not an hypocrite in the sight of men, and take good heed what thou speakest.
Exalt not thyself, lest thou fall, and bring dishonour upon thy soul, and so God discover thy secrets, and cast thee down in the midst of the congregation, because thou camest not in truth to the fear of the Lord, but thy heart is full of deceit.
And the Lord spoke to Aaron, saying, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house shall bear the sins of the holy things, and thou and thy sons shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
And take to thyself thy brethren the tribe of Levi, the family of thy father, and let them be joined to thee, and let them minister to thee; and thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.
And they shall keep thy charges, and the charges of the tabernacle; only they shall not approach the holy vessels and the altar, so both they and you shall not die.
And they shall be joined to thee, and shall keep the charges of the tabernacle of witness, in all the services of the tabernacle; and a stranger shall not approach to thee.
And ye shall keep the charges of the holy things, and the charges of the altar, and so there shall not be anger among the children of Israel.
And I have taken your brethren the Levites out of the midst of the children of Israel, a present given to the Lord, to minister in the services of the tabernacle of witness.
And thou and thy sons after thee shall keep up your priestly ministration, according to the whole manner of the altar, and that which is within the veil; and ye shall minister in the services as the office of your priesthood; and the stranger that comes near shall die.
And the Lord said to Aaron, And, behold, I have given you the charge of the first-fruits of all things consecrated to me by the children of Israel; and I have given them to thee as an honour, and to thy sons after thee for a perpetual ordinance.
And let this be to you from all the holy things that are consecrated to me, even the burnt-offerings, from all their gifts, and from all their sacrifices, and from every trespass-offering of theirs, and from all their sin-offerings, whatever things they give to me of all their holy things, they shall be thine and thy sons'.
And, behold, I have given to the sons of Levi every tithe in Israel for an inheritance for their services, whereinsoever they perform ministry in the tabernacle of witness.
And the children of Israel shall no more draw nigh to the tabernacle of witness to incur fatal guilt.
And the Levite himself shall perform the service of the tabernacle of witness; and they shall bear their iniquities, it is a perpetual statute throughout their generations; and in the midst of the children of Israel they shall not receive an inheritance.
Because I have given as a distinct portion to the Levites for an inheritance the tithes of the children of Israel, whatsoever they shall offer to the Lord; therefore I said to them, In the midst of the children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Thou shalt also speak to the Levites, and shalt say to them, If ye take the tithe from the children of Israel, which I have given you from them for an inheritance, then shall ye separate from it a heave-offering to the Lord, a tenth of the tenth.
And your heave-offerings shall be reckoned to you as corn from the floor, and an offering from the wine-press.
So shall ye also separate them from all the offerings of the Lord out of all your tithes, whatsoever ye shall receive from the children of Israel; and ye shall give of them an offering to the Lord to Aaron the priest.
Of all your gifts ye shall offer an offering to the Lord, and of every first-fruit the consecrated part from it.
And thou shalt say to them, When ye shall offer the first-fruits from it, then shall it be reckoned to the Levites as produce from the threshing-floor, and as produce from the wine-press.
And ye shall eat it in any place, ye and your families; for this is your reward for your services in the tabernacle of witness.
And ye shall not bear sin by reason of it, for ye shall have offered an offering of first-fruits from it, and ye shall not profane the holy things of the children of Israel, that ye die not.
Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner.
My son, hast thou sinned? do so no more, but ask pardon for thy former sins.
Flee from sin as from the face of a serpent: for if thou comest too near it, it will bite thee: the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a lion, slaying the souls of men.
All iniquity is as a two edged sword, the wounds whereof cannot be healed.
To terrify and do wrong will waste riches: thus the house of proud men shall be made desolate.
A prayer out of a poor man's mouth reacheth to the ears of God, and his judgment cometh speedily.
He that hateth to be reproved is in the way of sinners: but he that feareth the Lord will repent from his heart.
An eloquent man is known far and near; but a man of understanding knoweth when he slippeth.
He that buildeth his house with other men's money is like one that gathereth himself stones for the tomb of his burial.
The congregation of the wicked is like tow wrapped together: and the end of them is a flame of fire to destroy them.
The way of sinners is made plain with stones, but at the end thereof is the pit of hell.
He that keepeth the law of the Lord getteth the understanding thereof: and the perfection of the fear of the Lord is wisdom.
He that is not wise will not be taught: but there is a wisdom which multiplieth bitterness.
The knowledge of a wise man shall abound like a flood: and his counsel is like a pure fountain of life.
The inner parts of a fool are like a broken vessel, and he will hold no knowledge as long as he liveth.
If a skilful man hear a wise word, he will commend it, and add unto it: but as soon as one of no understanding heareth it, it displeaseth him, and he casteth it behind his back.
The talking of a fool is like a burden in the way: but grace shall be found in the lips of the wise.
They enquire at the mouth of the wise man in the congregation, and they shall ponder his words in their heart.
As is a house that is destroyed, so is wisdom to a fool: and the knowledge of the unwise is as talk without sense.
Doctrine unto fools is as fetters on the feet, and like manacles on the right hand.
A fool lifteth up his voice with laughter; but a wise man doth scarce smile a little.
Learning is unto a wise man as an ornament of gold, and like a bracelet upon his right arm.
A foolish man's foot is soon in his neighbour's house: but a man of experience is ashamed of him.
A fool will peep in at the door into the house: but he that is well nurtured will stand without.
It is the rudeness of a man to hearken at the door: but a wise man will be grieved with the disgrace.
The lips of talkers will be telling such things as pertain not unto them: but the words of such as have understanding are weighed in the balance.
The heart of fools is in their mouth: but the mouth of the wise is in their heart.
When the ungodly curseth Satan, he curseth his own soul.
A whisperer defileth his own soul, and is hated wheresoever he dwelleth.
Blessed are the blameless in the way, who walk in the law of the Lord.
Blessed are they that search out his testimonies: they will diligently seek him with the whole heart.

So shall I keep thy law continually, for ever and ever.
I walked also at large: for I sought out thy commandments.

They that fear thee will see me and rejoice: for I have hoped in thy words.

My soul shall live, and shall praise thee; and thy judgments shall help me.
And when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, into which thou goest to possess it, and shall remove great nations from before thee, the Chettite, and Gergesite, and Amorite, and Chananite, and Pherezite, and Evite, and Jebusite, seven nations more numerous and stronger than you,
and the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, then thou shalt smite them: thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt not make a covenant with them, neither shall ye pity them:
neither shall ye contract marriages with them: thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, and thou shalt not take his daughter to thy son.
For he will draw away thy son from me, and he will serve other gods; and the Lord will be very angry with you, and will soon utterly destroy thee.
But thus shall ye do to them; ye shall destroy their altars, and shall break down their pillars, and shall cut down their groves, and shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods.
For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God; and the Lord thy God chose thee to be to him a peculiar people beyond all nations that are upon the face of the earth.
It was not because ye are more numerous than all other nations that the Lord preferred you, and the Lord made choice of you: for ye are fewer in number than all other nations.
But because the Lord loved you, and as keeping the oath which he sware to your fathers, the Lord brought you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt.
Thou shalt know therefore, that the Lord thy God, he is God, a faithful God, who keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him, and for those that keep his commandments to a thousand generations,
and who recompenses them that hate him to their face, to destroy them utterly; and will not be slack with them that hate him: he will recompense them to their face.
Thou shalt keep therefore the commands, and the ordinances, and these judgments, which I command thee this day to do.
And it shall come to pass when ye shall have heard these ordinances, and shall have kept and done them, that the Lord thy God shall keep for thee the covenant and the mercy, which he sware to your fathers.
And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the off-spring of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, on the land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee.
Thou shalt be blessed beyond all nations; there shall not be among you an impotent or barren one, or among thy cattle.
And the Lord thy God shall remove from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou hast seen, and all that thou hast known, will he lay upon thee; but he will lay them upon all that hate thee.
And thou shalt eat all the spoils of the nations which the Lord thy God gives thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods; for this is an offence to thee.
But if thou shouldest say in thine heart, This nation is greater than I, how shall I be able to destroy them utterly?
thou shalt not fear them; thou shalt surely remember all that the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians:
the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, those signs and great wonders, the strong hand, and the high arm; how the Lord thy God brought thee forth: so the Lord your God will do to all the nations, whom thou fearest in their presence.
And the Lord thy God shall send against them the hornets, until they that are left and they that are hidden from thee be utterly destroyed.
Thou shalt not be wounded before them, because the Lord thy God in the midst of thee is a great and powerful God.
And the Lord thy God shall consume these nations before thee by little and little: thou shalt not be able to consume them speedily, lest the land become desert, and the wild beasts of the field be multiplied against thee.
And the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until ye shall have utterly destroyed them.
And he shall deliver their kings into your hands, and ye shall destroy their name from that place; none shall stand up in opposition before thee, until thou shalt have utterly destroyed them.
Ye shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods: thou shalt not covet their silver, neither shalt thou take to thyself gold from them, lest thou shouldest offend thereby, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.
And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, so shouldest thou be an accursed thing like it; thou shalt utterly hate it, and altogether abominate it, because it is an accursed thing.

The inheritance of the tribe of the children of Symeon was a part of the lot of Juda, for the portion of the children of Juda was greater than theirs; and the children of Symeon inherited in the midst of their lot.
And the third lot came out to Zabulon according to their families: the bounds of their inheritance shall beEsedekgola shall be their border,
the sea and Magelda, and it shall reach to Baetharaba in the valley, which is opposite Jekman.

And thence it shall come round in the opposite direction eastward to Gebere to the city of Catasem, and shall go on to Remmonaa Matharaoza.
And the borders shall come round northward to Amoth, and their going out shall be at Gaephael,

This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan, according to their families, these are their cities and their villages: and the children of Dan did not drive out the Amorite who afflicted them in the mountain; and the Amorite would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but they forcibly took from them the border of their portion.
And the sons of Dan went and fought against Lachis, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword; and they dwelt in it, and called the name of it Lasendan: and the Amorite continued to dwell in Edom and in Salamin: and the hand of Ephraim prevailed against them, and they became tribute to them.
And they proceeded to take possession of the land according to their borders, and the children of Israel gave an inheritance to Joshua the son of Naue among them,
by the command of God, and they gave him the city which he asked for, Thamnasarach, which is in the mount of Ephraim; and he built the city, and dwelt in it.
In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, between the evening times is the Lord's passover.
And on the fifteenth day of this month is the feast of unleavened bread to the Lord; seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread.
And the first day shall be a holy convocation to you: ye shall do no servile work.
And ye shall offer whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord seven days; and the seventh day shall be a holy convocation to you: ye shall do no servile work.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, When ye shall enter into the land which I give you, and reap the harvest of it, then shall ye bring a sheaf, the first-fruits of your harvest, to the priest;
and he shall lift up the sheaf before the Lord, to be accepted for you. On the morrow of the first day the priest shall lift it up.
And ye shall offer on the day on which ye bring the sheaf, a lamb without blemish of a year old for a whole-burnt-offering to the Lord.
Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war wherewith ye fight against the Chaldeans that have besieged you from outside the wall, and I will gather them into the midst of this city.
And I will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, with wrath and great anger.
And I will smite all the dwellers in this city, both men and cattle, with grievous pestilence: and they shall die.
And after this, thus saith the Lord; I will give Sedekias king of Juda, and his servants, and the people that is left in this city from the pestilence, and from the famine, and from the sword, into the hands of their enemies, that seek their lives: and they shall cut them in pieces with the edge of the sword: I will not spare them, and I will not have compassion upon them.
And thou shalt say to this people, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I have set before you the way of life, and the way of death.
He that remains in this city shall die by the sword, and by famine: but he that goes forth to advance to the Chaldeans that have besieged you, shall live, and his life shall be to him for a spoil, and he shall live.
For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good: it shall be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall consume it with fire.
O house of the king of Juda, hear ye the word of the Lord.
O house of David, thus saith the Lord; Judge judgment in the morning, and act rightly, and rescue the spoiled one from the hand of him that wrongs him, lest mine anger be kindled like fire, and it burn, and there be none to quench it.
Behold, I am against thee that dwellest in the valley of Sor; in the plain country, even against them that say, Who shall alarm us? or who shall enter into our habitation?
And I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it.
Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and shalt observe his appointments, and his ordinances, and his commandments, and his judgments, always.
And ye shall know this day; for I speak not to your children, who know not and have not seen the discipline of the Lord thy God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand, and his high arm,
and his miracles, and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharao king of Egypt, and all his land;
and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day;
and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until ye came into this place;
and all the things that he did to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel:
for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you to-day.
And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command thee to-day, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it:
that ye may live long upon the land, which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey.
For the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs:
but the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of heaven.
A land which the Lord thy God surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.
Now if ye will indeed hearken to all the commands which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul,
then he shall give to thy land the early and latter rain in its season, and thou shalt bring in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.
And he shall give food in thy fields to thy cattle; and when thou hast eaten and art full,
take heed to thyself that thy heart be not puffed up, and ye transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them:
and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given you.
And ye shall store these words in your heart and in your soul, and ye shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes.
And ye shall teach them to your children, so as to speak about them when thou sittest in the house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou sleepest, and when thou risest up.
And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses, and on your gates;
that your days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.
And it shall come to pass that if ye will indeed hearken to all these commands, which I charge thee to observe this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave close to him;
then the Lord shall cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall inherit great nations and stronger than yourselves.
Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be your; from the wilderness and Antilibanus, and from the great river, the river Euphrates, even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts.
No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the land, on which ye shall tread, as he told you.
Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse;
the blessing, if ye hearken to the commands of the Lord your God, all that I command you this day;
and the curse, if ye do not hearken to the commands of the Lord our God, as many as I command you this day, and ye wander from the way which I have commanded you, having gone to serve other gods, which ye know not.
And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land into which thou goest over to inherit it, then thou shalt put blessing on mount Garizin, and the curse upon mount Gaebal.
Lo! are not these beyond Jordan, behind, westward in the land of Chanaan, which lies westward near Golgol, by the high oak?
For ye are passing over Jordan, to go in and inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives you to inherit always, and ye shall dwell in it.
And ye shall take heed to do all his ordinances, and these judgments, as many as I set before you to-day.
And Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants, to slay David.
And Jonathan, Saul's son, loved David much: and Jonathan told David, saying, Saul seeks to kill thee: take heed to thyself therefore to-morrow morning, and hide thyself, and dwell in secret.
And I will go forth, and stand near my father in the field where thou shalt be, and I will speak concerning thee to my father; and I will see what his answer may be, and I will tell thee.
And Jonathan spoke favorably concerning David to Saul his father, and said to him, Let not the king sin against thy servant David, for he has not sinned against thee, and his deeds are very good.
And he put his life in his hand, and smote the Philistine, and the Lord wrought a great deliverance; and all Israel saw, and rejoined: why then dost thou sin against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?
And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; and Saul swore, saying, As the Lord lives, he shall not die.
And Jonathan called David, and told him all these words; and Jonathan brought David in to Saul, and he was before him as in former times.
And there was again war against Saul; and David did valiantly, and fought against the Philistines, and smote them with a very great slaughter, and they fled from before him.
And an evil spirit from God was upon Saul, and he was resting in his house, and a spear was in his hand, and David was playing on the harp with his hands.
And Saul sought to smite David with the spear; and David withdrew suddenly from the presence of Saul; and he drove the spear into the wall; and David retreated and escaped.
And it came to pass in that night, that Saul sent messengers to the house of David to watch him, in order to slay him in the morning; and Melchol David's wife told him, saying, Unless thou save thy life this night, to-morrow thou shalt be slain.
So Melchol lets David down by the window, and he departed, and fled, and escaped.
And Melchol took images, and laid them on the bed, and she put the liver of a goat by his head, and covered them with clothes.
And Saul sent messengers to take David; and they say that he is sick.
And he sends to David, saying, Bring him to me on the bed, that I may slay him.
And the messengers come, and, behold, the images were on the bed, and the goat's liver at his head.
And Saul said to Melchol, Why hast thou thus deceived me, and suffered my enemy to depart, and he has escaped? and Melchol said to Saul, He said, let me go, and if not, I will slay thee.
So David fled, and escaped, and comes to Samuel to Armathaim, and tells him all that Saul had done to him: and Samuel and David went, and dwelt in Navath in Rama.
And it was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is in Navath in Rama.
And Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw the assembly of the prophets, and Samuel stood as appointed over them; and the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they prophesy.
And it was told Saul, and he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied: and Saul sent again a third set of messengers, and they also prophesied.
And Saul was very angry, and went himself also to Armathaim, and he comes as far as the well of the threshing floor that is in Sephi; and he asked and said, Where are Samuel and David? And they said, Behold, in Navath in Rama.
And he went thence to Navath in Rama: and there came the Spirit of God upon him also, and he went on prophesying till he came to Navath in Rama.
And he took off his clothes, and prophesied before them; and lay down naked all that day and all that night: therefore they said, Is Saul also among the prophets?
And Booz went up to the gate, and sat there; and behold, the relative passed by, of whom Booz spoke: and Booz said to him, Turn aside, sit down here, such a one: and he turned aside and sat down.
And Booz took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye here; and they sat down.
And Booz said to the relative, The matter regards the portion of the field which was our brother Elimelech's which was given to Noemin, now returning out of the land of Moab;
and I said, I will inform thee, saying, Buy it before those that sit, and before the elders of my people: if thou wilt redeem it, redeem it, but if thou wilt not redeem it, tell me, and I shall know; for there is no one beside thee to do the office of a kinsman, and I am after thee: and he said, I am here, I will redeem it.
And Booz said, In the day of thy buying the field of the hand of Noemin and of Ruth the Moabitess the wife of the deceased, thou must also buy her, so as to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.
And the kinsman said, I shall not be able to redeem it for myself, lest I mar my own inheritance; do thou redeem my right for thyself, for I shall not be able to redeem it.
And this was in former time the ordinance in Israel for redemption, and for a bargain, to confirm every word: A man loosed his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour that redeemed his right; and this was a testimony in Israel.
And the kinsman said to Booz, Buy my right for thyself: and he took off his shoe and gave it to him.
And Booz said to the elders and to all the people, Ye are this day witnesses, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that belonged to Chelaion and Maalon, of the hand of Noemin.
Moreover I have bought for myself for a wife Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Maalon, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance; so the name of the dead shall not be destroyed from among his brethren, and from the tribe of his people: ye are this day witnesses.
And all the people who were in the gate said, We are witnesses: and the elders said, The Lord make thy wife who goes into thy house, as Rachel and as Lia, who both together built the house of Israel, and wrought mightily in Ephratha, and there shall be a name to thee in Bethleem.
And let thy house be as the house of Phares, whom Thamar bore to Juda, of the seed which the Lord shall give thee of this handmaid.
And Booz took Ruth, and she became his wife, and he went in to her; and the Lord gave her conception, and she bore a son.
And the woman said to Noemin, Blessed is the Lord, who has not suffered a redeemer to fail thee this day, even to make thy name famous in Israel.
And he shall be to thee a restorer of thy soul, and one to cherish thy old age; for thy daughter-in-law which has loved thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has born him.
And Noemin took the child and laid it in her bosom, and became a nurse to it.
And the neighbours gave it a name, saying, A son has been born to Noemin; and they called his name Obed; this is the father of Jessae the father of David.
And these are the generations of Phares: Phares begot Esrom:
Esrom begot Aram; and Aram begot Aminadab.
And Aminadab begot Naasson; and Naasson begot Salmon.
And Salmon begot Booz; and Booz begot Obed.
And Obed begot Jessae; and Jessae begot David.
Wine is an intemperate thing, and strong drink full of violence: but every fool is entangled with them.
The threat of a king differs not from the rage of a lion; and he that provokes him sins against his own soul.
It is a glory to a man to turn aside from railing; but every fool is entangled with such matters.
A sluggard when reproached is not ashamed: so also he who borrows corn in harvest.
Counsel in a man's heart is deep water; but a prudent man will draw it out.
A man is valuable, and a merciful man precious: but it is hard to find a faithful man.
He that walks blameless in justice, shall leave his children blessed.
Whenever a righteous king sits on the throne, no evil thing can stand before his presence.
Who will boast that he has a pure heart? or who will boldly say that he is pure from sins?
A large and small weight, and divers measures, are even both of them unclean before the Lord; and so is he that makes them.
A youth when in company with a godly man, will be restrained in his devices, and then his way will be straight.
The ear hears, and the eye sees: even both of them are the Lord's work.
Love not to speak ill, lest thou be cut off: open thine eyes, and be filled with bread.
A double weight is an abomination to the Lord; and a deceitful balance is not good in his sight.
A man's goings are directed of the Lord: how then can a mortal understand his ways?
It is a snare to a man hastily to consecrate some of his own property: for in that case repentance comes after vowing.
A wise king utterly crushes the ungodly, and will bring a wheel upon them.
The spirit of man is a light of the Lord, who searches the inmost parts of the belly.
Mercy and truth are a guard to a king, and will surround his throne with righteousness.
Wisdom is an ornament to young men; and grey hairs are the glory of old men.
Bruises and contusions befall bad men; and plagues shall come in the inward parts of their belly.
And Judas sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his shepherd the Odollamite, to receive the pledge from the woman; and he found her not.
And he asked the men of the place, Where is the harlot who was in Aenan by the way-side? and they said, There was no harlot here.
And he returned to Judas, and said, I have not found her; and the men of the place say, There is no harlot here.
And Judas said, Let her have them, but let us not be ridiculed; I sent this kid, but thou hast not found her.
And as they were bringing her, she sent to her father-in-law, saying, I am with child by the man whose these things are; and she said, See whose is this ring and bracelet and staff.
And Judas knew , and said, Thamar is cleared rather than I, forasmuch as I gave her not to Selom my son: and he knew her not again.
And it came to pass when she was in labour, that she also had twins in her womb.
Unto thee who dwellest in heaven have I lifted up mine eyes.
Behold, as the eyes of servants are directed to the hands of their masters, and as the eyes of a maidservant to the hands of her mistress; so our eyes are directed to the Lord our God, until he have mercy upon us.
Have pity upon us, O Lord, have pity upon us: for we are exceedingly filled with contempt.
Yea, our soul has been exceedingly filled with it: let the reproach be to them that are at ease, and contempt to the proud.
I will sing of thy mercies, O Lord, for ever: I will declare thy truth with my mouth to all generations.
For thou hast said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy truth shall be established in the heavens.
I made a covenant with my chosen ones, I sware unto David my servant.
I will establish thy seed for ever, and build up thy throne to all generations. Pause.
The heavens shall declare thy wonders, O Lord; and thy truth in the assembly of the saints.
For who in the heavens shall be compared to the Lord? and who shall be likened to the Lord among the sons of God?
God is glorified in the council of the saints; great and terrible toward all that are round about him.
O Lord God of hosts, who is like to thee? thou art mighty, O Lord, and thy truth is round about thee.
Thou rulest the power of the sea; and thou calmest the tumult of its waves.
Thou has brought down the proud as one that is slain; and with the arm of thy power thou has scattered thine enemies.
The heavens are thine, and the earth is thine: thou hast founded the world, and the fullness of it.
Thou hast created the north and the west: Thabor and Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.
Thine is the mighty arm: let thy hand be strengthened, let thy right hand be exalted.
Justice and judgment are the establishment of thy throne: mercy and truth shall go before thy face.
Blessed is the people that knows the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord, in the light of thy countenance.
And in thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy righteousness shall they be exalted.
For thou art the boast of their strength; and in thy good pleasure shall our horn be exalted,
for our help is of the Lord; and of the Holy One of Israel, our king.
Then thou spokest in vision to thy children, and saidst, I have laid help on a mighty one; I have exalted one chosen out of my people.
I have found David my servant; I have anointed him by my holy mercy.
For my hand shall support him; and mine arm shall strengthen him.
The enemy shall have no advantage against him; and the son of transgression shall not hurt him again.
And I will hew down his foes before him, and put to flight those that hate him.
But my truth and my mercy shall be with him; and in my name shall his horn be exalted.
And I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers.
He shall call upon me, saying, Thou art my Father, my God, and the helper of my salvation.
And I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth.
I will keep my mercy for him for ever, and my covenant shall be firm with him.
And I will establish his seed for ever and ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.
If his children should forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
if they should profane my ordinances, and not keep my commandments;
I will visit their transgressions with a rod, and their sins with scourges.
But my mercy I will not utterly remove from him, nor wrong my truth.
Neither will I by any means profane my covenant; and I will not make void the things that proceed out of my lips.
Once have I sworn by my holiness, that I will not lie to David.
His see shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me;
and as the moon that is established for ever, and as the faithful witness in heaven. Pause.
But thou hast cast off and set at nought, thou has rejected thine anointed.
Thou hast overthrown the covenant of thy servant; thou has profaned his sanctuary, casting it to the ground.
Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast made his strong holds a terror.
All that go by the way have spoiled him: he is become a reproach to his neighbours.
Thou hast exalted the right hand of his enemies; thou hast made all his enemies to rejoice.
Thou hast turned back the help of his sword, and hast not helped him in the battle.
Thou hast deprived him of glory: thou hast broken down his throne to the ground.
Thou hast shortened the days of his throne: thou hast poured shame upon him. Pause.
How long, O Lord, wilt thou turn away, for ever? shall thine anger flame out as fire?
Remember what my being is: for hast thou created all the sons of men in vain?
What man is there who shall live, and not see death? shall any one deliver his soul from the hand of Hades? Pause.
Where are thine ancient mercies, O Lord, which thou swarest to David in thy truth?
Remember, O Lord, the reproach of thy servants, which I have borne in my bosom, even the reproach of many nations;
wherewith thine enemies have reviled, O Lord: wherewith they have reviled the recompense of thine anointed.
Blessed be the Lord for ever. So be it, so be it.
THE WORD AGAINST DAMASCUS. Behold, Damascus shall be taken away from among cities, and shall become a ruin;
abandoned for ever, to be a fold and resting-place for flocks, and there shall be none to go after them.
And she shall no longer be a strong place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for thou art no better than the children of Israel, even than their glory; thus saith the Lord of hosts.
There shall be in that day a failure of the glory of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken.
And it shall be as if one should gather standing corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather ears in a rich valley;
and as if there should be left stubble therein, or as it were the berries of an olive tree, two or three on the topmost bough, or as if four or five should be left on their branches; thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel.
In that day a man shall trust in him that made him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.
And they shall not at all trust in their altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not look to the trees, nor to their abominations.
In that day thy cities shall be deserted, as the Amorites and the Evaeans deserted theirs, because of the children of Israel; and they shall be desolate.
Because thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy helper; therefore shalt thou plant a false plant, and a false seed.
In the day wherein thou shalt plant thou shalt be deceived; but if thou sow in the morning, the seed shall spring up for a crop in the day wherein thou shalt obtain an inheritance, and as a man's father, thou shalt obtain an inheritance for thy sons.
Woe to the multitude of many nations, as the swelling sea, so shall ye be confounded; and the force of many nations shall sound like water;
many nations like much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel.
Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance.
Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered; and let them that hate him flee from before him.
As smoke vanishes, let them vanish: as wax melts before the fire, so let the sinners perish from before God.
But let the righteous rejoice; let them exult before God: let them be delighted with joy.
Sing to God, sing praises to his name: make a way for him that rides upon the west (the Lord is his name) and exult before him. They shall be troubled before the face of him,
who is the father of the orphans, and judge of the widows: such is God in his holy place.
God settles the solitary in a house; leading forth prisoners mightily, also them that act provokingly, even them that dwell in tombs.
O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou wentest through the wilderness; Pause:
the earth quaked, yea, the heavens dropped water at the presence of the God of Sina, at the presence of the God of Israel.
O God, thou wilt grant to thine inheritance a gracious rain; for it was weary, but thou didst refresh it.
Thy creatures dwell in it: thou hast in thy goodness prepared for the poor.
The Lord God will give a word to them that preach it in a great company.
The king of the forces of the beloved, of the beloved, will even grant them for the beauty of the house to divide the spoils.
Even if ye should lie among the lots, ye shall have the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her breast with yellow gold.
When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made snow-white in Selmon.
The mountain of God is a rich mountain; a swelling mountain, a rich mountain.
Wherefore do ye conceive evil, ye swelling mountains? this is the mountain which God has delighted to dwell in; yea, the Lord will dwell in it for ever.
The chariots of God are ten thousand fold, thousands of rejoicing ones: the Lord is among them, in Sina, in the holy place.
Thou art gone up on high, thou hast led captivity captive, thou hast received gifts for man, yea, for they were rebellious, that thou mightest dwell among them.
Blessed be the Lord God, blessed be the Lord daily; and the God of our salvation shall prosper us. Pause.
Our God is the God of salvation; and to the Lord belong the issues from death.
But God shall crust the heads of his enemies; the hairy crown of them that go on in their trespasses.
The Lord said, I will bring again from Basan, I will bring my people again through the depths of the sea.
That thy foot may be dipped in blood, and the tongue of thy dogs be stained with that of thine enemies.
Thy goings, O God, have been seen; the goings of my God, the king, in the sanctuary.
The princes went first, next before the players on instruments, in the midst of damsels playing on timbrels.
Praise God in the congregations, the Lord from the fountains of Israel.
There is Benjamin the younger one in ecstasy, the princes of Juda their rulers, the princes of Zabulon, the princes of Nephthali.
O God, command thou thy strength: strengthen, O God, this which thou hast wrought in us.
Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents to thee.
Rebuke the wild beasts of the reed: let the crowd of bulls with the heifers of the nations be rebuked, so that they who have been proved with silver may not be shut out: scatter thou the nations that wish for wars.
Ambassadors shall arrive out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall hasten to stretch out her hand readily to God.
Sing to God, ye kingdoms of the earth; sing psalms to the Lord. Pause.
Sing to God that rides on the heaven of heaven, eastward: lo, he will utter a mighty sound with his voice.
Give ye glory to God: his excellency is over Israel, and his power is in the clouds.
God is wonderful in his holy places, the God of Israel: he will give power and strength to his people: blessed be God.
And it came to pass after many days after the Lord had given Israel rest from all his enemies round about, that Joshua was old and advanced in years.
And Joshua called together all the children of Israel, and their elders, and their chiefs, and their judges, and their officers; and said to them, I am old and advanced in years.
And ye have seen all that the Lord our God has done to all these nations before us; for it is the Lord your God who has fought for you.
See, that I have given to you these nations that are left to you by lots to your tribes, all the nations beginning at Jordan; and some I have destroyed; and the boundaries shall be at the great sea westward.
And the Lord our God, he shall destroy them before us, until they utterly perish; and he shall send against them the wild beasts, until he shall have utterly destroyed them and their kings from before you; and ye shall inherit their land, as the Lord our God said to you.
Do ye therefore strive diligently to observe and do all things written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not to the right hand or to the left;
that ye go not in among these nations that are left; and the names of their gods shall not be named among you, neither shall ye serve them, neither shall ye bow down to them.
But ye shall cleave to the Lord our God, as ye have done until this day.
And the Lord shall destroy them before you, even great and strong nations; and no one has stood before us until this day.
One of you has chased a thousand, for the Lord our God, he fought for you, as he said to us.
And take ye great heed to love the Lord our God.
For if ye shall turn aside and attach yourselves to these nations that are left with you, and make marriages with them, and become mingled with them and they with you,
know that the Lord will no more destroy these nations from before you; and they will be to you snares and stumbling-blocks, and nails in your heels, and darts in your eyes, until ye be destroyed from off this good land, which the Lord your God has given you.
But I hasten to go the way of death, as all that are upon the earth also do: and ye know in your heart and in your soul, that not one word has fallen to the ground of all the words which the Lord our God has spoken respecting all that concerns us; there has not one of them failed.
And it shall come to pass, that as all the good things are come upon us which the Lord God will bring upon you all the evil things, until he shall have destroyed you from off this good land, which the Lord has given you,
when ye transgress the covenant of the Lord our God, which he has charged us, and go and serve other gods, and bow down to them.
And the children of Israel continued to do evil against the Lord; and Aod was dead.
And the Lord sold the children of Israel into the hand of Jabin king of Chanaan, who ruled in Asor; and the chief of his host was Sisara, and he dwelt in Arisoth of the Gentiles.
And the children of Israel cried to the Lord, because he had nine hundred chariots of iron; and he mightily oppressed Israel twenty years.
And Debbora, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.
And she sat under the palm-tree of Debbora between Rama and Baethel in mount Ephraim; and the children of Israel went up to her for judgment.
And Debbora sent and called Barac the son of Abineem out of Cades Nephthali, and she said to him, Has not the Lord God of Israel commanded thee? and thou shalt depart to mount Thabor, and shalt take with thyself ten thousand men of the sons of Nephthali and of the sons of Zabulon.
And I will bring to thee to the torrent of Kison Sisara the captain of the host of Jabin, and his chariots, and his multitude, and I will deliver them into thine hands.
And Barac said to her, If thou wilt go with me, I will go; and if thou wilt not go, I will not go; for I know not the day on which the Lord prospers his messenger with me.
And she said, I will surely go with thee; but know that thy honour shall not attend on the expedition on which thou goest, for the Lord shall sell Sisara into the hands of a women: and Debbora arose, and went with Barac out of Cades.
And Barac called Zabulon and Nephthali out of Cades, and there went up at his feet ten thousand men, and Debbora went up with him.
And Chaber the Kenite had removed from Caina, from the sons of Jobab the father-in-law of Moses, and pitched his tent by the oak of the covetous ones, which is near Kedes.
And it was told Sisara that Barac the son of Abineem was gone up to mount Thabor.
And Sisara summoned all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron and all the people with him, from Arisoth of the Gentiles to the brook of Kison.
And Debbora said to Barac, Rise up, for this is the day on which the Lord has delivered Sisara into thy hand, for the Lord shall go forth before thee: and Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand men after him.
And the Lord discomfited Sisara, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barac: and Sisara descended from off his chariot, and fled on his feet.
And Barac pursued after the chariots and after the army, into Arisoth of the Gentiles; and the whole army of Sisara fell by the edge of the sword, there was not one left.
And Sisara fled on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Chaber the Kenite his friend: for there was peace between Jabin king of Asor and the house of Chaber the Kenite.
And Jael went, out to meet Sisara, and said to him, Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me, fear not: and he turned aside to her into the tent; and she covered him with a mantle.
And Sisara said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty: and she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him.
And Sisara said to her, Stand now by the door of the tent, and it shall come to pass if any man come to thee, and ask of thee, and say, Is there any man here? then thou shalt say, There is not.
And Jael the wife of Chaber took a pin of the tent, and took a hammer in her hand, and went secretly to him, and fastened the pin in his temple, and it went through to the earth, and he fainted away, and darkness fell upon him and he died.
And, behold, Barac was pursuing Sisara: and Jael went out to meet him, and he said to him, Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest: and he went in to her; and, behold, Sisara was fallen dead, and the pin was in his temple.
So God routed Jabin king of Chanaan in that day before the children of Israel.
And the hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin king of Chanaan, until they utterly destroyed Jabin king of Chanaan.
Therefore I will return, and take away my corn in its season, and my wine in its time; and I will take away my raiment and my linen clothes, so that she shall not cover her nakedness.
And now I will expose her uncleanness before her lovers, and no one shall by any means deliver her out of my hand.
And I will take away all her gladness, her feasts, and her festivals at the new moon, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.
And I will utterly destroy her vines, and her fig-trees, all things of which she said, These are my hire which my lovers have given me: and I will make them a testimony, and the wild beasts of the field, and the birds of the sky, and the reptiles of the earth shall devour them.
Therefore, behold, I will cause her to err, and will make her as desolate, and will speak comfortably to her.
And I will giver her possessions from thence, and the valley of Achor to open her understanding: and she shall be afflicted there according to the days of her infancy, and according to the days of her coming up out of the land of Egypt.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, that she shall call me, My husband, and shall no longer call me Baalim.
And I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and their names shall be remembered no more at all.
And I will make for them in that day a covenant with the wild beasts of the field, and with the birds of the sky, and with the reptiles of the earth: and I will break the bow and the sword and the battle from off the earth, and will cause thee to dwell safely.
And I will betroth thee to myself for ever; yea, I will betroth thee to myself in righteousness, and in judgment, and in mercy, and in tender compassions;
and I will betroth thee to myself in faithfulness: and thou shalt know the Lord.
And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord, I will hearken to the heaven, and it shall hearken to the earth;
and the earth shall hearken to the corn, and the wine, and the oil; and they shall hearken to Jezrael.
And I will sow her to me on the earth; and will love her that was not loved, and will say to that which was not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art the Lord my God.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the congregation of the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye shall be holy; for I the Lord your God am holy.
Let every one of you reverence his father and his mother; and ye shall keep my sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.
Ye shall not follow idols, and ye shall not make to yourselves molten gods: I am the Lord your God.
And if ye will sacrifice a peace-offering to the Lord, ye shall offer it acceptable from yourselves.
In what day soever ye shall sacrifice it, it shall be eaten; and on the following day, and if any of it should be left till the third day, it shall be thoroughly burnt with fire.
And if it should be at all eaten on the third day, it is unfit for sacrifice: it shall not be accepted.
And he that eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has profaned the holy things of the Lord; and the souls that eat it shall be destroyed from among their people.
And when ye reap the harvest of your land, ye shall not complete the reaping of your field with exactness, and thou shalt not gather that which falls from thy reaping.
And thou shalt not go over the gathering of thy vineyard, neither shalt thou gather the remaining grapes of thy vineyard: thou shalt leave them for the poor and the stranger: I am the Lord your God.
Ye shall not steal, ye shall not lie, neither shall one bear false witness as an informer against his neighbour.
And ye shall not swear unjustly by my name, and ye shall not profane the holy name of your God: I am the Lord your God.
Thou shalt not injure thy neighbour, neither do thou rob him, neither shall the wages of thy hireling remain with thee until the morning.
Thou shalt not revile the deaf, neither shalt thou put a stumbling-block in the way of the blind; and thou shalt fear the Lord thy God: I am the Lord your God.
Thou shalt not act unjustly in judgment: thou shalt not accept the person of the poor, nor admire the person of the mighty; with justice shalt thou judge thy neighbour.
Thou shalt not walk deceitfully among thy people; thou shalt not rise up against the blood of thy neighbour: I am the Lord your God.
The stranger that comes to you shall be among you as the native, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.
Ye shall not act unrighteously in judgment, in measures and weights and scales.
There shall be among you just balances and just weights and just liquid measure. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
And ye shall keep all my law and all my ordinances, and ye shall do them: I am the Lord your God.
And it came to pass, when they had finished eating the corn which they had brought out of Egypt, that their father said to them, Go again; buy us a little food.
And Judas spoke to him, saying, The man, the lord of the country, positively testified to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
If, then, thou send our brother with us, we will go down, and buy thee food;
but if thou send not our brother with us, we will not go: for the man spoke to us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, unless your younger brother be with you.
And the man did as Joseph said; and he brought the men into the house of Joseph.
And the men, when they perceived that they were brought into the house of Joseph, said, We are brought in because of the money that was returned in our sacks at the first; even in order to inform against us, and lay it to our charge; to take us for servants, and our asses.
And having approached the man who was over the house of Joseph, they spoke to him in the porch of the house,
And we have brought other money with us to buy food; we know not who put the money into our sacks.
And he said to them, mercifully with you; be not afraid; your God, and the God of your fathers, has given you treasures in your sacks, and I have enough of your good money. And he brought Symeon out to them.
And he brought water to wash their feet; and gave provender to their asses.
And they prepared their gifts, until Joseph came at noon, for they heard that he was going to dine there.
Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith God.
Speak, ye priests, to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is accomplished, her sin is put away: for she has received of the Lord's hand double the amount of her sins.
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God.
Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and all the crooked ways shall become straight, and the rough places plains.
And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken it.
The voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass:
The grass withers, and the flower fades:
but the word of our God abides for ever.
O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear not; say unto the cities of Juda, Behold your God!
Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with strength, and his arm is with power: behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.
He shall tend his flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall soothe them that are with young.
Who has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests in a balance?
Who has known the mind of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him?
Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way of understanding;
since all the nations are counted as a drop from a bucket, and as the turning of a balance, and shall be counted as spittle?
And Libanus is not enough to burn, nor all beasts enough for a whole-burnt offering:
and all the nations are as nothing, and counted as nothing.
To whom have ye compared the Lord? and with what likeness have ye compared him?
Has not the artificer made an image, or the goldsmith having melted gold, gilt it over, and made it a similitude?
For the artificer chooses out a wood that will not rot, and will wisely enquire how he shall set up his image, and that so that it should not be moved.
Will ye not know? will ye not hear? has it not been told you of old? Have ye not known the foundations of the earth?
It is he that comprehends the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants in it are as grasshoppers; he that set up the heaven as a chamber, and stretched it out as a tent to dwell in:
he that appoints princes to rule as nothing, and has made the earth as nothing.
For they shall not plant, neither shall they sow, neither shall their root be fixed in the ground: he has blown upon them, and they are withered, and a storm shall carry them away like sticks.
Now then to whom have ye compared me, that I may be exalted? saith the Holy One.
Lift up your eyes on high, and see, who has displayed all these things? even he that brings forth his host by number: he shall call them all by name by means of his great glory, and by the power of his might: nothing has escaped thee.
For say not thou, O Jacob, and why hast thou spoken, Israel, saying, My way is hid from God, and my God has taken away my judgement, and has departed?
And now, hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the eternal God, the God that formed the ends of the earth, shall not hunger, nor be weary, and there is no searching of his understanding.
He gives strength to the hungry, and sorrow to them that are not suffering.
For the young men shall hunger, and the youths shall be weary, and the choice men shall be powerless:
but they that wait on God shall renew their strength; they shall put forth new feathers like eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not hunger.
Tobias then answered and said, Father, I will do all things which thou hast commanded me:
But how can I receive the money, seeing I know him not?
Then he gave him the handwriting, and said unto him, Seek thee a man which may go with thee, whiles I yet live, and I will give him wages: and go and receive the money.
Therefore when he went to seek a man, he found Raphael that was an angel.
But he knew not; and he said unto him, Canst thou go with me to Rages? and knowest thou those places well?
To whom the angel said, I will go with thee, and I know the way well: for I have lodged with our brother Gabael.
Then Tobias said unto him, Tarry for me, till I tell my father.
Then he said unto him, Go and tarry not. So he went in and said to his father, Behold, I have found one which will go with me. Then he said, Call him unto me, that I may know of what tribe he is, and whether he be a trusty man to go with thee.
So he called him, and he came in, and they saluted one another.
So they were well pleased. Then said he to Tobias, Prepare thyself for the journey, and God send you a good journey. And when his son had prepared all things far the journey, his father said, Go thou with this man, and God, which dwelleth in heaven, prosper your journey, and the angel of God keep you company. So they went forth both, and the young man's dog with them.
But Anna his mother wept, and said to Tobit, Why hast thou sent away our son? is he not the staff of our hand, in going in and out before us?
Be not greedy to add money to money: but let it be as refuse in respect of our child.
For that which the Lord hath given us to live with doth suffice us.
O Lord, I have hoped in thee; let me never be ashamed: deliver me in thy righteousness and rescue me.
Incline thine ear to me; make haste to rescue me: be thou to me for a protecting God, and for a house of refuge to save me.
For thou art my strength and my refuge; and thou shalt guide me for thy name's sake, and maintain me.
Thou shalt bring me out of the snare which they have hidden for me; for thou, O Lord, art my defender.
Into thine hands I will commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of truth.
Thou has hated them that idly persist in vanities: but I have hoped in the Lord.
I will exult and be glad in thy mercy: for thou hast looked upon mine affliction; thou hast saved my soul from distresses.
And thou hast not shut me up into the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a wide place.
Pity me, O Lord, for I am afflicted: my eye is troubled with indignation, my soul and by belly.
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with groanings: my strength has been weakened through poverty, and my bones are troubled.
I became a reproach among all mine enemies, but exceedingly so to my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that saw me without fled from me.
I have been forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am become as a broken vessel.
For I heard the slander of many that dwelt round about: when they were gathered together against me, they took counsel to take my life.
But I hoped in thee, O Lord: I said, Thou art my God.
My lots are in thy hands: deliver me from the hand of mine enemies,
and from them that persecute me. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me in thy mercy.
O Lord, let me not be ashamed, for I have called upon thee: let the ungodly be ashamed, and brought down to Hades.
Let the deceitful lips become dumb, which speak iniquity against the righteous with pride and scorn.
How abundant is the multitude of thy goodness, O Lord, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee! thou hast wrought it out for them that hope on thee, in the presence of the sons of men.
Thou wilt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the vexation of man: thou wilt screen them in a tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues.
Blessed be the Lord: for he has magnified his mercy in a fortified city.
But I said in my extreme fear, I am cast out from the sight of thine eyes: therefore thou didst hearken, O Lord, to the voice of my supplication when I cried to thee.
Love the Lord, all ye his saints: for the Lord seeks for truth, and renders a reward to them that deal very proudly.
Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord.
And they departed from Aelim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Aelim and Sina; and on the fifteenth day, in the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt,
all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron.
And the children of Israel said to them, Would we had died smitten by the Lord in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, and ate bread to satiety! for ye have brought us out into this wilderness, to slay all this congregation with hunger.
And Moses and Aaron said to all the congregation of the children of Israel, At even ye shall know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt;
and in the morning ye shall see the glory of the Lord, inasmuch as he hears your murmuring against God; and who are we, that ye continue to murmur against us?
And Moses said, This shall be when the Lord gives you in the evening flesh to eat, and bread in the morning to satiety, because the Lord has heard your murmuring, which ye murmur against us: and what are we? for your murmuring is not against us, but against God.
And Moses said to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before God; for he has heard your murmuring.
And when Aaron spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, and they turned toward the wilderness, then the glory of the Lord appeared in a cloud.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel: speak to them, saying, Towards evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be satisfied with bread; and ye shall know that I am the Lord your God.
And it was evening, and quails came up and covered the camp:
in the morning it came to pass as the dew ceased round about the camp, that, behold, on the face of the wilderness was a small thing like white coriander seed, as frost upon the earth.
And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, What is this? for they knew not what it was; and Moses said to them,
This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat. This is that which the Lord has appointed: gather of it each man for his family, a homer for each person, according to the number of your souls, gather each of you with his fellow-lodgers.
And the children of Israel did so, and gathered some much and some less.
And having measured the homer full, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that had gathered less had no lack; each gathered according to the need of those who belonged to him.
And Moses said to them, Let no man leave of it till the morning.
But they did not hearken to Moses, but some left of it till the morning; and it bred worms and stank: and Moses was irritated with them.
And they gathered it every morning, each man what he needed, and when the sun waxed hot it melted.
And it came to pass on the sixth day, they gathered double what was needed, two homers for one man; and all the chiefs of the synagogue went in and reported it to Moses.
And Moses said to them, Is not this the word which the Lord spoke? To-morrow is the sabbath, a holy rest to the Lord: bake that ye will bake, and seethe that ye will seethe, and all that is over leave to be laid by for the morrow.
And they left of it till the morning, as Moses commanded them; and it stank not, neither was there a worm in it.
And Moses said, Eat that to-day, for to-day is a sabbath to the Lord: it shall not be found in the plain.
Six days ye shall gather it, and on the seventh day is a sabbath, for there shall be none on that day.
And it came to pass on the seventh day that some of the people went forth to gather, and found none.
And the Lord said to Moses, How long are ye unwilling to hearken to my commands and my law?
See, for the Lord has given you this day as the sabbath, therefore he has given you on the sixth day the bread of two days: ye shall sit each of you in your houses; let no one go forth from his place on the seventh day.
And the people kept sabbath on the seventh day.
And the children of Israel called the name of it Man; and it was as white coriander seed, and the taste of it as a wafer with honey.
And Moses said, This is the thing which the Lord hath commanded, Fill an homer with manna, to be laid up for your generations; that they may see the bread which ye ate in the wilderness, when the Lord led you forth out of the land of Egypt.
And Moses said to Aaron, Take a golden pot, and cast into it one full homer of manna; and thou shalt lay it up before God, to be kept for your generations,
as the Lord commanded Moses: and Aaron laid it up before the testimony to be kept.
And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to the land they ate the manna, until they came to the region of Phoenicia.
Now the homer was the tenth part of three measures.
The Mighty One shall thunder wonderfully with his voice: for he has done great things which we knew not;
commanding the snow, Be thou upon the earth, and the stormy rain, and the storm of the showers of his might.
He seals up the hand of every man, that every man may know his own weakness.
And the wild beasts come in under the covert, and rest in their lair.
Troubles come on out of the secret chambers, and cold from the mountain-tops.
And from the breath of the Mighty One he will send frost; and he guides the water in whatever way he pleases.
And he will carry round the encircling clouds by his governance, to perform their works: whatsoever he shall command them,
Hearken to this, O Job: stand still, and be admonished of the power of the Lord.
We know that god has disposed his works, having made light out of darkness.
And he knows the divisions of the clouds, and the signal overthrows of the ungodly.
But thy robe is warm, and there is quiet upon the land.
Wherefore teach me, what shall we say to him? and let us cease from saying much.
Have I a book or a scribe my me, that I may stand and put man to silence?
But the light is not visible to all: it shines afar off in the heavens, as that which is from him in the clouds.
From the north come the clouds shining like gold: in these great are the glory and honour of the Almighty;
and we do not find another his equal in strength: as for him that judges justly, dost thou not think that he listens?
Wherefore men shall fear him; and the wise also in heart shall fear him.
Then Tobit wrote a prayer of rejoicing, and said, Blessed be God that liveth for ever, and blessed be his kingdom.
For he doth scourge, and hath mercy: he leadeth down to hell, and bringeth up again: neither is there any that can avoid his hand.
Confess him before the Gentiles, ye children of Israel: for he hath scattered us among them.
There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.
And he will scourge us for our iniquities, and will have mercy again, and will gather us out of all nations, among whom he hath scattered us.
If ye turn to him with your whole heart, and with your whole mind, and deal uprightly before him, then will he turn unto you, and will not hide his face from you. Therefore see what he will do with you, and confess him with your whole mouth, and praise the Lord of might, and extol the everlasting King. In the land of my captivity do I praise him, and declare his might and majesty to a sinful nation. O ye sinners, turn and do justice before him: who can tell if he will accept you, and have mercy on you?
I will extol my God, and my soul shall praise the King of heaven, and shall rejoice in his greatness.
Let all men speak, and let all praise him for his righteousness.
O Jerusalem, the holy city, he will scourge thee for thy children's works, and will have mercy again on the sons of the righteous.
Give praise to the Lord, for he is good: and praise the everlasting King, that his tabernacle may be builded in thee again with joy, and let him make joyful there in thee those that are captives, and love in thee for ever those that are miserable.
Many nations shall come from far to the name of the Lord God with gifts in their hands, even gifts to the King of heaven; all generations shall praise thee with great joy.
Cursed are all they which hate thee, and blessed shall all be which love thee for ever.
Rejoice and be glad for the children of the just: for they shall be gathered together, and shall bless the Lord of the just.
O blessed are they which love thee, for they shall rejoice in thy peace: blessed are they which have been sorrowful for all thy scourges; for they shall rejoice for thee, when they have seen all thy glory, and shall be glad for ever.
Let my soul bless God the great King.
For Jerusalem shall be built up with sapphires and emeralds, and precious stone: thy walls and towers and battlements with pure gold.
And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.
And all her streets shall say, Alleluia; and they shall praise him, saying, Blessed be God, which hath extolled it for ever.
Blessed is the man that does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness.
Let not the stranger who attaches himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people: and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree.
Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and take hold of my covenant;
I will give to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail.
And I will give it to the strangers that attach themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be to him servants and handmaids; and as for all that keep my sabbaths from profaning them, and that take hold of my covenant;
I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden them in my house of prayer: their whole-burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations,
saith the Lord that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a congregation.
All ye beasts of the field, come, devour, all ye beasts of the forest.
See how they are all blinded: they have not known; they are dumb dogs that will not bark; dreaming of rest, loving to slumber.
Yea, they are insatiable dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no understanding: all have followed their own ways, each according to his will.
But Job answered and said,
Hear ye, hear ye my words, that I may not have this consolation from you.
Raise me, and I will speak; then ye shall not laugh me to scorn.
What! is my reproof of man? and why should I not be angry?
Look upon me, and wonder, laying your hand upon your cheek.
For even when I remember, I am alarmed, and pains seize my flesh.
Wherefore do the ungodly live, and grow old even in wealth?
Their seed is according to their desire, and their children are in their sight.
Their houses are prosperous, neither have they any where cause for fear, neither is there a scourge from the Lord upon them.
Their cow does not cast her calf, and their beast with young is safe, and does not miscarry.
And they remain as an unfailing flock, and their children play before them, taking up the psaltery and harp;
and they rejoice at the voice of a song.
And they spend their days in wealth, and fall asleep in the rest of the grave.
Yet such a man says to the Lord, Depart from me; I desire not to know thy ways.
For their good things were in their hands, but he regards not the works of the ungodly.
Nevertheless, the lamp of the ungodly also shall be put out, and destruction shall come upon them, and pangs of vengeance shall seize them.
And they shall be as chaff before the wind, or as dust which the storm has taken up.
Let his substance fail to supply his children: God shall recompense him, and he shall know it.
Let his eyes see his own destruction, and let him not be saved by the Lord.
For his desire is in his house with him, and the number of his months has been suddenly cut off.
Is it not the Lord who teaches understanding and knowledge? and does not he judge murders?
And another dies in bitterness of soul, not eating any good thing.
But they lie down in the earth together, and corruption covers them.
So I know you, that ye presumptuously attack me:
How then do ye comfort me in vain? whereas I have no rest from your molestation.
And it was told David, saying, behold, the Philistines war in Keila, and they rob, they trample on the threshing-floors.
And David enquired of the Lord, saying, Shall I go and smite these Philistines? And the Lord said, Go, and thou shalt smite these Philistines, and shalt save Keila.
And the men of David said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judea; and how shall it be if we go to Keila? Shall we go after the spoils of the Philistines?
And David enquired yet again of the Lord; and the Lord answered him, and said to him, Arise and go down to Keila, for I will deliver the Philistines into thy hands.
So David and his men with him went to Keila, and fought with the Philistines; and they fled from before him, and he carried off their cattle, and smote them with a great slaughter, and David rescued the inhabitants of Keila.
And it came to pass when Abiathar the son of Achimelech fled to David, that he went down with David to Keila, having and ephod in his hand.
And it was told Saul that David was come to Keila: and Saul said, God has sold him into my hands, for he is shut up, having entered into a city that has gates and bars.
And Saul charged all the people to go down to war to Keila, to besiege David and his men.
And David knew that Saul spoke openly of mischief against him: and David said to Abiathar the priest, Bring the ephod of the Lord.
And David said, Lord God of Israel, thy servant has indeed heard, that Saul seeks to come against Keila to destroy the city on my account.
Will the place be shut up? And now will Saul come down, as thy servant has heard? Lord God of Israel, tell thy servant.
And the Lord said, It will be shut up.
And David arose, and the men with him, in number about four hundred, and they went forth from Keila, and went whithersoever they could go: and it was told Saul that David had escaped from Keila, and he forbore to come.
And he dwelt in Maserem in the wilderness, in the narrow passes; and dwelt in the wilderness in mount Ziph, in the dry country. And Saul sought him continually, but the Lord delivered him not into his hands.
And David perceived that Saul went forth to seek David; and David was in the dry mountain in the New Ziph.
And Jonathan son of Saul rose, and went to David to Caene, and strengthened his hands in the Lord.
And he said to him, Fear not, for the hand of Saul my father shall not find thee; and thou shalt be king over Israel, and I shall be second to thee; and Saul my father knows it.
So they both made a covenant before the Lord; and David dwelt in Caene, and Jonathan went to his home.
And the Ziphites came up out of the dry country to Saul to the hill, saying, Behold, is not David hidden with us in Messara, in the narrows in Caene in the hill of Echela, which is on the right of Jessaemon?
And now according to all the king's desire to come down, let him come down to us; they have shut him up into the hands of the king.
And Saul said to them, Blessed be ye of the Lord, for ye have been grieved on my account.
Go, I pray you, and make preparations yet, and notice his place where his foot shall be, quickly, in that place which ye spoke of, lest by any means he should deal craftily.
Take notice, then, and learn, and I will go with you; and it shall come to pass that if he is in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Juda.
And the Ziphites arose, and went before Saul: and David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, westward, to the right of Jessaemon.
And Saul and his men went to seek him: and they brought word to David, and he went down to the rock that was in the wilderness of Maon: and Saul heard, and followed after David to the wilderness of Maon.
And Saul and his men go on one side of the mountain, and David and his men are on the other side of the mountain: and David was hiding himself to escape from Saul: and Saul and his men encamped against David and his men, in order to take them.
And there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste thee, and come hither, for the Philistines have invaded the land.
So Saul returned from following after David, and went to meet the Philistines: therefore that place was called The divided Rock.
The Lord is my light and my Saviour; whom shall I fear? the Lord is the defender of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
When evil-doers drew nigh against me to eat up my flesh, my persecutors and mine enemies, they fainted and fell.
Though an army should set itself in array against me, my heart shall not be afraid: though war should rise up against me, in this am I confident.
One thing have I asked of the Lord, this will I earnestly seek: that I should dwell in the house of the Lord, all the days of my life, that I should behold the fair beauty of the Lord, and survey his temple.
For in the day of mine afflictions he hid me in his tabernacle: he sheltered me in the secret of his tabernacle; he set me up on a rock.
And now, behold, he has lifted up mine head over mine enemies: I went round and offered in his tabernacle the sacrifice of joy; I will sing even sing psalms to the Lord.
Hear, O Lord, my voice which I have uttered aloud: pity me, and hearken to me.
My heart said to thee, I have diligently sought thy face: thy face, O Lord, I will seek.
Turn not thy face away from me, turn not thou away from thy servant in anger: be thou my helper, forsake me not; and, O God my Saviour, overlook me not.
For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken me to himself.
Teach me, O Lord, in thy way, and guide me in a right path, because of mine enemies.
Deliver me not over to the desire of them that afflict me; for unjust witnesses have risen up against me, and injustice has lied within herself.
I believe that I shall see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living.
Wait on the Lord: be of good courage, and let thy heart be strengthened: yea wait on the Lord.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Charge the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Ye are entering into the land of Chanaan: it shall be to you for an inheritance, the land of Chanaan with its boundaries.
And your southern side shall be from the wilderness of Sin to the border of Edom, and your border southward shall extend on the side of the salt sea eastward.
And your border shall go round you from the south to the ascent of Acrabin, and shall proceed by Ennac, and the going forth of it shall be southward to Cades Barne, and it shall go forth to the village of Arad, and shall proceed by Asemona.
And the border shall compass from Asemona to the river of Egypt, and the sea shall be the termination.
And ye shall have your border on the west, the great sea shall be the boundary: this shall be to you the border on the west.
And this shall be your northern border; from the great sea ye shall measure to yourselves, by the side of the mountain.
And ye shall measure to yourselves the mountain from mount Hor at the entering in to Emath, and the termination of it shall be the coasts of Saradac.
And the border shall go out to Dephrona, and its termination shall be at Arsenain; this shall be your border from the north.
And ye shall measure to yourselves the eastern border from Arsenain to Sepphamar.
And the border shall go down from Sepphamar to Bela eastward to the fountains, and the border shall go down from Bela behind the sea Chenereth eastward.
And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the termination shall be the salt sea; this shall be your land and its borders round about.
And Moses charged the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, even as the Lord commanded us to give it to the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasse.
The vision which Esaias the son of Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.
Hear, O heaven, and hearken, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, saying, I have begotten and reared up children, but they have rebelled against me.
The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me.
Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: ye have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
Why should ye be smitten any more, transgressing more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad.
From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer are healed: it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages.
Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations.
The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.
And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been made like Gomorrha.
Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, thou people of Gomorrha.
Of what value to me is the abundance of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am full of whole-burnt-offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats:
neither shall ye come with these to appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? Ye shall no more tread my court.
Though ye bring fine flour, it is vain; incense is an abomination to me; I cannot bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and the great day;
your fasting, and rest from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: ye have become loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins.
When ye stretch forth your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you: and though ye make many supplications, I will not hearken to you; for your hands are full of blood.
Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities;
learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow.
And come, let us reason together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make them white as wool.
And if ye be willing, and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good of the land:
but if ye be not willing, nor hearken to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
How has the faithful city Sion, once full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now murderers.
Your silver is worthless, thy wine merchants mix the wine with water.
Thy princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows.
Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty men of Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against mine adversaries, and I will execute judgment on mine enemies.
And I will bring my hand upon thee, and purge thee completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from thee all transgressors.
And I will establish thy judges as before, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion.
For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy.
And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed.
For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted.
For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water.
And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench them.
Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise the Lord, ye his servants,
who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.
Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises to his name; for it is good.
For the Lord has chosen Jacob for himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.
For I know that the Lord is great, and our Lord is above all gods;
all that the Lord willed, he did in heaven, and on the earth, in the sea, and in all deeps.
Who brings up clouds from the extremity of the earth: he has made lightnings for the rain: he brings winds out of his treasures.
Who smote the first-born of Egypt, both of man and beast.
He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, on Pharao, and on all his servants.
Who smote many nations, and slew mighty kings;
Seon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Basan, and all the kingdoms of Chanaan:
and gave their land for an inheritance, an inheritance to Israel his people.
O Lord, thy name endures for ever, and thy memorial to all generations.
For the Lord shall judge his people, and comfort himself concerning his servants.
The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the works of men's hands.
They have a mouth, but they cannot speak; they have eyes, but they cannot see;
they have ears, but they cannot hear; for there is no breath in their mouth.
Let those who make them be made like to them; and all those who trust in them.
O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord:
O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless the Lord.
Blessed in Sion be the Lord, who dwells in Jerusalem.
O God, give thy judgment to the king, and thy righteousness to the king's son;
that he may judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
Let the mountains and the hills raise peace to thy people:
he shall judge the poor of the people in righteousness, and save the children of the needy; and shall bring low the false accuser.
And he shall continue as long as the sun, and before the moon for ever.
He shall come down as rain upon a fleece; and as drops falling upon the earth.
In his days shall righteousness spring up; and abundance of peace till the moon be removed.
And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.
The Ethiopians shall fall down before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tharsis, and the isles, shall bring presents: the kings of the Arabians and Saba shall offer gifts.
And all kings shall worship him; all the Gentiles shall serve him.
For he has delivered the poor from the oppressor; and the needy who had no helper.
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall deliver the souls of the needy.
He shall redeem their souls from usury and injustice: and their name shall be precious before him.
And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the gold of Arabia: and men shall pray for him continually; and all the day shall they praise him.
There shall be an establishment on the earth on the tops of the mountains: the fruit thereof shall be exalted above Libanus, and they of the city shall flourish as grass of the earth.
Let his name be blessed for ever: his name shall endure longer than the sun: and all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all nations shall call him blessed.
Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who alone does wonders.
And blessed is his glorious name for ever, even for ever and ever: and all the earth shall be filled with his glory. So be it, so be it.
And David passed on a little way from Ros; and, behold, Siba the servant of Memphibosthe came to meet him; and he had a couple of asses laden, and upon them two hundred loaves, and a hundred bunches of raisins, and a hundred cakes of dates, and bottle of wine.
And the king said to Siba, What meanest thou by these? and Siba, said, The asses are for the household of the king to sit upon, and the loaves and the dates are for the young men to eat, and the wine is for them that are faint in the wilderness to drink.
And the king said, And where is the son of thy master? and Siba said to the king, Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, To-day shall the house of Israel restore to me the kingdom of my father.
And the king said to Siba, Behold, all Memphibosthe's property is thine. And Siba did obeisance and said, My lord, O king, let me find grace in thine eyes.
And king David came to Baurim; and, behold, there came out from thence a man of the family of the house of Saul, and his name was Semei the son of Gera. He came forth and cursed as he went,
and cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on the right and left hand of the king.
And thus Semei said when he cursed him, Go out, go out, thou bloody man, and man of sin.
The Lord has returned upon thee all the blood of the house of Saul, because thou hast reigned in his stead; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of Abessalom thy son: and, behold, thou art taken in thy mischief, because thou art a bloody man.
And Abessa the son of Saruia said to the king, Why does this dead dog curse my lord the king? let me go over now and take off his head.
And the king said, What have I to do with you, ye sons of Saruia? even let him alone, and so let him curse, for the Lord has told him to curse David: and who shall say, Why hast thou done thus?
And David said to Abessa and to all his servants, Behold, my son who came forth out of my bowels seeks my life; still more now may the son of Benjamin: let him curse, because the Lord has told him.
If by any means the Lord may look on my affliction, thus shall he return me good for his cursing this day.
And David and all the men with him went on the way: and Semei went by the side of the hill next to him, cursing as he went, and casting stones at him, and sprinkling him with dirt.
And the king, and all the people with him, came away and refreshed themselves there.
And Abessalom and all the men of Israel went into Jerusalem, and Achitophel with him.
And it came to pass when Chusi the chief friend of David came to Abessalom, that Chusi said to Abessalom, Let the king live.
And Abessalom said to Chusi, Is this thy kindness to thy friend? why wentest thou not forth with thy friend?
And Chusi said to Abessalom, Nay, but following whom the Lord, and this people, and all Israel have chosen, his will I be, and with him I will dwell.
And again, whom shall I serve? should I not in the presence of his son? As I served in the sight of thy father, so will I be in thy presence.
And Abessalom said to Achitophel, Deliberate among yourselves concerning what we should do.
And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Go in to thy father's concubines, whom he left to keep his house; and all Israel shall hear that thou hast dishonoured thy father; and the hands of all that are with thee shall be strengthened.
And they pitched a tent for Abessalom on the roof, and Abessalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.
And the counsel of Achitophel, which he counselled in former days, was as if one should enquire of the word of God: so was all the counsel of Achitophel both to David and also to Abessalom.
Assur shall never save us; we will not mount on horseback; we will no longer say to the works of our hands, Our gods. He who is in thee shall pity the orphan.
I will restore their dwellings, I will love them truly: for he has turned away my wrath from him.
I will be as dew to Israel: he shall bloom as the lily, and cast forth his roots as Libanus.
His branches shall spread, and he shall be as a fruitful olive, and his smell shall be as the smell of Libanus.
They shall return, and dwell under his shadow: they shall live and be satisfied with corn, and he shall flower as a vine: his memorial shall be to Ephraim as the wine of Libanus.
And the men of Ephraim assembled themselves, and passed on to the north, and said to Jephthae, Wherefore didst thou go over to fight with the children of Ammon, and didst not call us to go with thee? we will burn thy house over thee with fire.
And Jephthae said to them, I and my people and the children of Ammon were very much engaged in war; and I called for you, and ye did not save me out of their hand.
And I saw that thou wert no helper, and I put my life in my hand, and passed on to the sons of Ammon; and the Lord delivered them into my hand: and wherefore are ye come up against me this day to fight with me?
And Jephthae gathered all the men of Galaad, and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Galaad smote Ephraim, because they that were escaped of Ephraim said, Ye are of Galaad in the midst of Ephraim and in the midst of Manasse.
And Galaad took the fords of Jordan before Ephraim; and they that escaped of Ephraim said to them, Let us go over: and the men of Galaad said, Art thou an Ephrathite? and he said, No.
Then they said to him, Say now Stachys; and he did not rightly pronounce it so: and they took him, and slew him at the fords of Jordan; and there fell at that time of Ephraim two and forty thousand.
And Jephthae judged Israel six years; and Jephthae the Galaadite died, and was buried in his city Galaad.
And after him Abaissan of Bethleem judged Israel.
And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent forth; and he brought in thirty daughters for his sons from without; and he judged Israel seven years.
And Abaissan died, and was buried in Bethleem.
And after him Aelom of Zabulon judged Israel ten years.
And Aelom of Zabulon died, and was buried in Aelom in the land of Zabulon.
And after him Abdon the son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, judged Israel.
And he had forty sons, and thirty grandsons, that rode upon seventy colts: and he judged Israel eight years.
And Abdon the son of Ellel, the Pharathonite, died, and was buried in Pharathon in the land of Ephraim in the mount of Amalec.
And Achitophel said to Abessalom, Let me now choose out for myself twelve thousand men, and I will arise and follow after David this night:
and I will come upon him when he is weary and weak-handed, and I will strike him with terror; and all the people with him shall flee, and I will smite the king only of all.
And I will bring back all the people to thee, as a bride returns to her husband: only thou seekest the life of one man, and all the people shall have peace.
And the saying was right in the eyes of Abessalom, and in the eyes of all the elders of Israel.
And Abessalom said, Call now also Chusi the Arachite, and let us hear what is in his mouth, even in his also.
And Chusi went in to Abessalom, and Abessalom spoke to him, saying, After this manner spoke Achitophel: shall we do according to his word? but if not, do thou speak.
And Chusi said to Abessalom, This counsel which Achitophel has counselled this one time is not good.
And Chusi said, Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are very mighty, and bitter in their spirit, as a bereaved bear in the field, and as a wild boar in the plain: and thy father is a man of war, and will not give the people rest.
For, behold, he is now hidden in one of the hills or in some other place: and it shall come to pass when he falls upon them at the beginning, that some one will certainly hear, and say, There has been a slaughter among the people that follow after Abessalom.
Then even he that is strong, whose heart is as the heart of a lion, it shall utterly melt: for all Israel knows that thy father is mighty, and they that are with him are mighty men.
For thus I have surely given counsel, that all Israel be generally gathered to thee from Dan even to Bersabee, as the sand that is upon the sea-shore for multitude: and that thy presence go in the midst of them.
And we will come upon him in one of the places where we shall find him, and we will encamp against him, as the dew falls upon the earth; and we will not leave of him and of his men so much as one.
And if he shall have taken refuge with his army in a city, then shall all Israel take ropes to that city, and we will draw it even into the river, that there may not be left there even a stone.
And Abessalom, and all the men of Israel said, The counsel of Chusi the Arachite is better than the counsel of Achitophel. For the Lord ordained to disconcert the good counsel of Achitophel, that the Lord might bring all evil upon Abessalom.
And Chusi the Arachite said to Sadoc and Abiathar the priests, Thus and thus Achitophel counselled Abessalom and the elders of Israel; and thus and thus have I counselled.
And now send quickly and report to David, saying, Lodge not this night in Araboth of the wilderness: even go and make haste, lest one swallow up the king, and all the people with him.
And Jonathan and Achimaas stood by the well of Rogel, and a maid-servant went and reported to them, and they go and tell king David; for they might not be seen to enter into the city.
But a young man saw them and told Abessalom: and the two went quickly, and entered into the house of a man in Baurim; and he had a well in his court, and they went down into it.
And a woman took a covering, and spread it over the mouth of the well, and spread out ground corn upon it to dry, and the thing was not known.
And the servants of Abessalom came to the woman into the house, and said, Where are Achimaas and Jonathan? and the woman said to them, They are gone a little way beyond the water. And they sought and found them not, and returned to Jerusalem.
And it came to pass after they were gone, that they came up out of the pit, and went on their way; and reported to king David, and said to David, Arise ye and go quickly over the water, for thus has Achitophel counselled concerning you.
And David rose up and all the people with him, and they passed over Jordan till the morning light; there was not one missing who did not pass over Jordan.
And Achitophel saw that his counsel was not followed, and he saddled his ass, and rose and departed to his house into his city; and he gave orders to his household, and hanged himself, and died, and was buried in the sepulchre of his father.
And David passed over to Manaim: and Abessalom crossed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.
And Abessalom appointed Amessai in the room of Joab over the host. And Amessai was the son of a man whose name was Jether of Jezrael: he went in to Abigaia the daughter of Naas, the sister of Saruia the mother of Joab.
And all Israel and Abessalom encamped in the land of Galaad.
And it came to pass when David came to Manaim, that Uesbi the son of Naas of Rabbath of the sons of Ammon, and Machir son of Amiel of Lodabar, and Berzelli the Galaadite of Rogellim,
brought ten embroidered beds, (with double coverings,) and ten caldrons, and earthenware, and wheat, and barley, and flour, and meal, and beans, and pulse,
and honey, and butter, and sheep, and cheeses of kine: and they brought them to David and to his people with him to eat; for one said, The people is faint and hungry and thirsty in the wilderness.
And the children of Israel yet again committed iniquity before the Lord; and the Lord delivered them into the hand of the Phylistines forty years.
And there was a man of Saraa, of the family of the kindred of Dan, and his name was Manoe, and his wife was barren, and bore not.
And an angel of the Lord appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold, thou art barren and hast not born; yet thou shalt conceive a son.
And now be very cautious, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing;
for behold, thou art with child, and shalt bring forth a son; and there shall come no razor upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb; and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Phylistines.
And the woman went in, and spoke to her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his appearance was as of an angel of God, very dreadful; and I did not ask him whence he was, and he did not tell me his name.
And he said to me, Behold, thou art with child, and shalt bring forth a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat no unclean thing; for the child shall be holy to God from the womb until the day of his death.
And Manoe prayed to the Lord and said, I pray thee, O Lord my lord, concerning the man of God whom thou sentest; let him now come to us once more, and teach us what we shall do to the child about to be born.
And the Lord heard the voice of Manoe, and the angel of God came yet again to the woman; and she sat in the field, and Manoe her husband was not with her.
And the woman hasted, and ran, and brought word to her husband, and said to him, Behold the man who came in the other day to me has appeared to me.
And Manoe arose and followed his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Art thou the man that spoke to the woman? and the angel said, I am.
And Manoe said, Now shall thy word come to pass: what shall be the ordering of the child, and our dealings with him?
And the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, Of all things concerning which I spoke to the woman, she shall beware.
She shall eat of nothing that comes of the vine yielding wine, and let her not drink wine or strong liquor, and let her not eat anything unclean: all things that I have charged her she shall observe.
And Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, Let us detain thee here, and prepare before thee a kid of the goats.
And the angel of the Lord said to Manoe, If thou shouldest detain me, I will not eat of thy bread; and if thou wouldest offer a whole-burnt-offering, to the Lord thou shalt offer it: for Manoe knew not that he was an angel of the Lord.
And Manoe said to the angel of the Lord, What is thy name, that when thy word shall come to pass, we may glorify thee?
And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why dost thou thus ask after my name; whereas it is wonderful?
And Manoe took a kid of the goats and its meat-offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord; and the angel wrought a distinct work, and Manoe and his wife were looking on.
And it came to pass when the flame went up above the altar toward heaven, that the angel of the Lord went up in the flame; and Manoe and his wife were looking, and they fell upon their face to the earth.
And the angel appeared no more to Manoe and to his wife: then Manoe knew that this was an angel of the Lord.
And Manoe said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.
But his wife said to him, If the Lord were pleased to slay us, he would not have received of our hand a whole-burnt-offering and a meat-offering; and he would not have shewn us all these things, neither would he have caused us to hear all these things
And the woman brought forth a son, and she called his name Sampson; and the child grew, and the Lord blessed him.
And the Spirit of the Lord began to go out with him in the camp of Dan, and between Saraa and Esthaol.

and redeemed us from our enemies; for his mercy endures for ever.
Who gives food to all flesh; for his mercy endures for ever.
Give thanks to the God of heaven; for his mercy endures for ever.
O Lord, I have hoped in thee: let me never be put to shame.
In thy righteousness deliver me and rescue me: incline thine ear to me, and save me.
Be to me a protecting God, and a strong hold to save me: for thou art my fortress and my refuge.
Deliver me, O my God, from the hand of the sinner, from the hand of the transgressor and unjust man.
For thou art my support, O Lord; O Lord, thou art my hope from my youth.
On thee have I been stayed from the womb: from the belly of my mother thou art my protector: of thee is my praise continually.
I am become as it were a wonder to many: but thou art my strong helper.
Let my mouth be filled with praise, that I may hymn thy glory, and thy majesty all the day.
Cast me not off at the time of old age; forsake me not when my strength fails.
For mine enemies have spoken against me; and they that lay wait for my soul have taken counsel together,
saying, God has forsaken him: persecute ye and take him; for there is none to deliver him.
O God, go not far from me, O my God, draw nigh to my help.
Let those that plot against my soul be ashamed and utterly fail: let those that seek my hurt be clothed with shame and dishonour.
But I will hope continually, and will praise thee more and more.
My mouth shall declare thy righteousness openly, and thy salvation all the day; for I am not acquainted with the affairs of men.
I will go on in the might of the Lord: O Lord, I will make mention of thy righteousness only.
O God, thou hast taught me from my youth, and until now will I declare thy wonders;
even until I am old and advanced in years. O God, forsake me not; until I shall have declared thine arm to all the generation that is to come:
even thy power and thy righteousness, O God, up to the highest heavens, even the mighty works which thou has done: O God, who is like to thee?
What afflictions many and sore hast thou shewed me! yet thou didst turn and quicken me, and broughtest me again from the depths of the earth.
Thou didst multiply thy righteousness, and didst turn and comfort me, and broughtest me again out of the depths of the earth.
I will also therefore give thanks to thee, O God, because of thy truth, on an instrument of psalmody: I will sing psalms to thee on the harp, O Holy One of Israel.
My lips shall rejoice when I sing to thee; and my soul, which thou hast redeemed.
Moreover also my tongue shall dwell all the day upon thy righteousness; when they shall be ashamed and confounded that seek my hurt.
The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.
Vanity of vanities, said the Preacher, vanity of vanities; all is vanity.
What advantage is there to a man in all his labour that he takes under the sun?
A generation goes, and a generation comes: but the earth stands for ever.
And the sun arises, and the sun goes down and draws toward its place;
arising there it proceeds southward, and goes round toward the north. The wind goes round and round, and the wind returns to its circuits.
All the rivers run into the sea; and yet the sea is not filled: to the place whence the rivers come, thither they return again.
All things are full of labour; a man will not be able to speak of them: neither shall the eye be satisfied with seeing, neither shall the ear be filled with hearing.
What is that which has been? the very thing which shall be: and what is that which has been done? the very thing which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.
Who is he that shall speak and say, Behold, this is new? it has already been in the ages that have passed before us.
There is no memorial to the first things; neither to the things that have been last shall their memorial be with them that shall at the last time.
I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.
And I applied my heart to seek out and examine by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven, for God has given to the sons of men an evil trouble to be troubled therewith.
I beheld all the works that were wrought under the sun; and, beheld, all were vanity and waywardness of spirit.
That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and deficiency cannot be numbered.
I spoke in my heart, saying, Behold, I am increased, and have acquired wisdom beyond all who were before me in Jerusalem: also I applied my heart to know wisdom and knowledge.
And my heart knew muchwisdom, and knowledge, parables and understanding: I perceived that this also is waywardness of spirit.
For in the abundance of wisdom is abundance of knowledge; and he that increases knowledge will increase sorrow.
And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden,
but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.
For God knew that in whatever day ye should eat of it your eyes would be opened, and ye would be as gods, knowing good and evil.
And the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes to look upon and beautiful to contemplate, and having taken of its fruit she ate, and she gave to her husband also with her, and they ate.
And the eyes of both were opened, and they perceived that they were naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons to go round them.
And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the afternoon; and both Adam and his wife hid themselves from the face of the Lord God in the midst of the trees of the garden.
And the Lord God called Adam and said to him, Adam, where art thou?
And he said to him, I heard thy voice as thou walkedst in the garden, and I feared because I was naked and I hid myself.
And God said to him, Who told thee that thou wast naked, unless thou hast eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it alone not to eat?
And Adam said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with meshe gave me of the tree and I ate.
And the Lord God said to the woman, Why hast thou done this? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me and I ate.
And the Lord God said to the serpent, Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all cattle and all the brutes of the earth, on thy breast and belly thou shalt go, and thou shalt eat earth all the days of thy life.
And I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed, he shalt watch against thy head, and thou shalt watch against his heel.
And to the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pains and thy groanings; in pain thou shalt bring forth children, and thy submission shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.
And to Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and eaten of the tree concerning which I charged thee of it only not to eatof that thou hast eaten, cursed the ground in thy labours, in pain shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life.
Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herb of the field.
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat thy bread until thou return to the earth out of which thou wast taken, for earth thou art and to earth thou shalt return.
And Adam called the name of his wife Life, because she was the mother of all living.
And the Lord God made for Adam and his wife garments of skin, and clothed them.
And God said, Behold, Adam is become as one of us, to know good and evil, and now lest at any time he stretch forth his hand, and take of the tree of life and eat, and he shall live forever
So the Lord God sent him forth out of the garden of Delight to cultivate the ground out of which he was taken.
And he cast out Adam and caused him to dwell over against the garden of Delight, and stationed the cherubs and the fiery sword that turns about to keep the way of the tree of life.
Then Tobit called his son Tobias, and said unto him, My son, see that the man have his wages, which went with thee, and thou must give him more.
And Tobias said unto him, O father, it is no harm to me to give him half of those things which I have brought:
For he hath brought me again to thee in safety, and made whole my wife, and brought me the money, and likewise healed thee.
Then the old man said, It is due unto him.
So he called the angel, and he said unto him, Take half of all that ye have brought and go away in safety.
Then he took them both apart, and said unto them, Bless God, praise him, and magnify him, and praise him for the things which he hath done unto you in the sight of all that live. It is good to praise God, and exalt his name, and honourably to shew forth the works of God; therefore be not slack to praise him.
It is good to keep close the secret of a king, but it is honourable to reveal the works of God. Do that which is good, and no evil shall touch you.
Prayer is good with fasting and alms and righteousness. A little with righteousness is better than much with unrighteousness. It is better to give alms than to lay up gold:
For alms doth deliver from death, and shall purge away all sin. Those that exercise alms and righteousness shall be filled with life:
But they that sin are enemies to their own life.
Surely I will keep close nothing from you. For I said, It was good to keep close the secret of a king, but that it was honourable to reveal the works of God.
Now therefore, when thou didst pray, and Sara thy daughter in law, I did bring the remembrance of your prayers before the Holy One: and when thou didst bury the dead, I was with thee likewise.
And when thou didst not delay to rise up, and leave thy dinner, to go and cover the dead, thy good deed was not hid from me: but I was with thee.
And now God hath sent me to heal thee and Sara thy daughter in law.
I am Raphael, one of the seven holy angels, which present the prayers of the saints, and which go in and out before the glory of the Holy One.
Then they were both troubled, and fell upon their faces: for they feared.
But he said unto them, Fear not, for it shall go well with you; praise God therefore.
For not of any favour of mine, but by the will of our God I came; wherefore praise him for ever.
All these days I did appear unto you; but I did neither eat nor drink, but ye did see a vision.
Now therefore give God thanks: for I go up to him that sent me; but write all things which are done in a book.
And when they arose, they saw him no more.
Then they confessed the great and wonderful works of God, and how the angel of the Lord had appeared unto them.
See how the just man has perished, and no one lays it to heart: and righteous men are taken away, and no one considers: for the righteous has been removed out of the way of injustice.
His burial shall be in peace: he has been removed out of the way.
But draw ye near hither, ye lawless children, the seed of adulterers and the harlot.
Wherein have ye been rioting? and against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye loosed your tongue? are ye not children of perdition? a lawless seed?
who call upon idols under the leafy trees, slaying your children in the valleys among the rocks?
That is thy portion, this is thy lot: and to them hast thou poured forth drink-offerings, and to these hast thou offered meat-offerings. Shall I not therefore be angry for these things?
On a lofty and high mountain, there is thy bed, and thither thou carriedst up thy meat-offerings:
and behind the posts of thy door thou didst place thy memorials. Didst thou think that if thou shouldest depart from me, thou wouldest gain? thou hast loved those that lay with thee;
and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom with them, and thou hast increased the number of them that are far from thee, and hast sent ambassadors beyond thy borders, and hast been debased even to hell.
Thou has wearied thyself with thy many ways; yet thou saidst not, I will cease to strengthen myself: for thou has done these things; therefore thou has not supplicated me.
Through dread of whom hast thou feared, and lied against me, and has not remembered, nor considered me, nor regarded me, yea, though when I see thee I pass thee by, yet thou has not feared me.
And I will declare thy righteousness, and thy sins, which shall not profit thee.
When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in thine affliction: for all these the wind shall take, and the tempest shall carry them away: but they that cleave to me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain.
And they shall say, Clear the ways before him, and take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.
Thus saith the Most High, who dwells on high for ever, Holy in the holies, is his name, the Most High resting in the holies, and giving patience to the faint-hearted, and giving life to the broken-hearted:
I will not take vengeance on you for ever, neither will I be always angry with you: for my Spirit shall go forth from me, and I have created all breath.
On account of sin for a little while I grieved him, and smote him, and turned away my face from him; and he was grieved, and he went on sorrowful in his ways.
I have seen his ways, and healed him, and comforted him, and given him true comfort;
peace upon peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh: and the Lord has said, I will heal them.
But the unrighteous shall be tossed as troubled waves, and shall not be able to rest.
There is no joy to the ungodly, said God.
Then Sophar the Minaean answered and said,
I did not suppose that thou wouldest answer thus: neither do ye understand more than I.
I will hear my shameful reproach; and the spirit of my understanding answers me.
Hast thou not known these things of old, from the time that man was set upon the earth?
But the mirth of the ungodly is a signal downfall, and the joy of transgressors is destruction:
although his gifts should go up to heaven, and his sacrifice reach the clouds.
For when he shall seem to be now established, then he shall utterly perish: and they that knew him shall say, Where is he?
Like a dream that has fled away, he shall not be found; and he has fled like a vision of the night.
Let his inferiors destroy his children, and let his hands kindle the fire of sorrow.
yet he shall not at all be able to help himself; the gall of an asp is in his belly.
His wealth unjustly collected shall be vomited up; a messenger of wrath shall drag him out of his house.
And let him suck the poison of serpents, and let the serpent's tongue slay him.
Let him not see the milk of the pastures, nor the supplies of honey and butter.
He has laboured unprofitably and in vain, for wealth of which he shall not taste: it is as a lean thing, unfit for food, which he cannot swallow.
For he has broken down the houses of many mighty men: and he has plundered an habitation, though he built it not.
There is no security to his possessions; he shall not be saved by his desire.
There is nothing remaining of his provisions; therefore his goods shall not flourish.
But when he shall seem to be just satisfied, he shall be straitened; and all distress shall come upon him.
If by any means he would fill his belly, let God send upon him the fury of wrath; let him bring a torrent of pains upon him.
And he shall by no means escape from the power of the sword; let the brazen bow wound him.
And let the arrow pierce through his body; and let the stars be against his dwelling-place: let terrors come upon him.
And let all darkness wait for him: a fire that burns not out shall consume him; and let a stranger plague his house.
And let the heaven reveal his iniquities, and the earth rise up against him.
Let destruction bring his house to an end; let a day of wrath come upon him.
This is the portion of an ungodly man from the Lord, and the possession of his goods appointed him by the all-seeing God.
And David departed thence, and escaped; and he comes to the cave of Odollam, and his brethren hear, and the house of his father, and they go down to him there.
And there gathered to him every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and every one that was troubled in mind; and he was a leader over them, and there were with him about four hundred men.
And David departed thence to Massephath of Moab, and said to the king of Moab, Let, I pray thee, my father and my mother be with thee, until I know what God will do to me.
And he persuaded the King of Moab, and they dwell with him continually, while David was in the hold.
And Gad the prophet said to David, Dwell not in the hold: go, and thou shalt enter the land of Juda. So David went, and came and dwelt in the city of Saric.
And Saul heard that David was discovered, and his men with him: now Saul dwelt in the hill below the field that is in Rama, and his spear was in his hand, and all his servants stood near him.
And Saul said to his servants that stood by him, Hear now, ye sons of Benjamin, will the son of Jessae indeed give all of you fields and vineyards, and will he make you all captains of hundreds and captains of thousands?
That ye are conspiring against me, and there is no one that informs me, whereas my son has made a covenant with the son of Jessae, and there is no one of you that is sorry for me, or informs me, that my son has stirred up my servant against me for an enemy, as it is this day?
And Doec the Syrian who was over the mules of Saul answered and said, I saw the son of Jessae as he came to Nomba to Abimelech son of Achitob the priest.
And the priest enquired of God for him, and gave him provision, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.
And the king sent to call Abimelech son of Achitob and all his father's sons, the priests that were in Nomba; and they all came to the king.
And Saul said, Hear now, thou son of Achitob. And he said, Lo! I am here, speak, my lord.
And Saul said to him, Why have thou and the son of Jessae conspired against me, that thou shouldest give him bread and a sword, and shouldest enquire of God for him, to raise him up against me as an enemy, as he is this day?
And he answered the king, and said, And who is there among all thy servants faithful as David, and he is a son-in-law of the king, and he is executor of all thy commands, and is honourable in thy house?
Have I begun to-day to enquire of God for him? By no means: let not the king bring a charge against his servant, and against thee whole of my father's house; for thy servant knew not in all these matters anything great or small.
And king Saul said, Thou shalt surely die, Abimelech, thou, and all thy father's house.
And the king said to the footmen that attended on him, Draw nigh and slay the priests of the Lord, because their hand is with David, and because they knew that he fled, and they did not inform me. But the servants of the king would not lift their hands to fall upon the priest of the Lord.
And the king said to Doec, Turn thou, and fall upon the priests: and Doec the Syrian turned, and slew the priests of the Lord in that day, three hundred and five men, all wearing an ephod.
And he smote Nomba the city of the priest with the edge of the sword, both man, and woman, infant and suckling, and calf, and ox, and sheep.
And one son of Abimelech son of Achitob escapes, and his name was Abiathar, and he fled after David.
And Abiathar told David that Saul had slain all the priests of the Lord.
And David said to Abiathar, I knew it in that day, that Doec the Syrian would surely tell Saul: I am guilty of the death of the house of thy father.
Dwell with me; fear not, for wherever I shall seek a place of safety for my life, I will also seek a place for thy life, for thou art safely guarded while with me.
These are the names of the sons of Israel that came into Egypt together with Jacob their father; they came in each with their whole family.
Ruben, Simeon, Levi, Judas,
Issachar, Zabulon, Benjamin,
Dan and Nephthalim, Gad and Aser.
But Joseph was in Egypt. And all the souls born of Jacob were seventy-five.
And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation.
And the children of Israel increased and multiplied, and became numerous and grew exceedingly strong, and the land multiplied them.
And there arose up another king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.
And he said to his nation, Behold, the race of the children of Israel is a great multitude, and is stronger than we:
come then, let us deal craftily with them, lest at any time they be increased, and whensoever war shall happen to us, these also shall be added to our enemies, and having prevailed against us in war, they will depart out of the land.
And he set over them task-masters, who should afflict them in their works; and they built strong cities for Pharao, both Pitho, and Ramesses, and On, which is Heliopolis.
But as they humbled them, by so much they multiplied, and grew exceedingly strong; and the Egyptians greatly abhorred the children of Israel.
And they embittered their life by hard labours, in the clay and in brick-making, and all the works in the plains, according to all the works, wherein they caused them to serve with violence.
And the king of the Egyptians spoke to the midwives of the Hebrews; the name of the one was, Sepphora; and the name of the second, Phua.
And he said, When ye do the office of midwives to the Hebrew women, and they are about to be delivered, if it be a male, kill it; but if a female, save it.
But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt appointed them; and they saved the male children alive.
And the king of Egypt called the midwives, and said to them, Why is it that ye have done this thing, and saved the male children alive?
And the midwives said to Pharao, The Hebrew women are not as the women of Egypt, for they are delivered before the midwives go in to them. So they bore children.
And God did well to the midwives, and the people multiplied, and grew very strong.
And as the midwives feared God, they established for themselves families.
And Pharao charged all his people, saying, Whatever male child shall be born to the Hebrews, cast into the river; and every female, save it alive.
To thee, O Lord, have I cried; my God, be not silent toward me: lest thou be silent toward me, and so I should be likened to them that go down to the pit.
Hearken to the voice of my supplication, when I pray to thee, when I lift up my hands toward thy holy temple.
Draw not away my soul with sinners, and destroy me not with the workers of iniquity, who speak peace with their neighbours, but evils are in their hearts.
Give them according to their works, and according to the wickedness of their devices: give them according to the works of their hands; render their recompense unto them.
Because they have not attended to the works of the Lord, even to the works of his hands, thou shalt pull them down, and shalt not build them up.
Blessed be the Lord, for he has hearkened to the voice of my petition.
The Lord is my helper and my defender; my heart has hoped in him, and I am helped: my flesh has revived, and willingly will I give praise to him.
The Lord is the strength of his people, and the saving defender of his anointed.
Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: and take care of them, and lift them up for ever.
And at the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be manifest, established on the tops of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and the peoples shall hasten to it.
And many nations shall go, and say, Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and they shall shew us his way, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Sion shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
And he shall judge among many peoples, and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles; and nation shall no more lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.
And every one shall rest under his vine, and every one under his fig-tree; and there shall be none to alarm them: for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken these words.
For all other nations shall walk everyone in his own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever.
In that day, saith the Lord, I will gather her that is bruised, and will receive her that is cast out, and those whom I rejected.
And I will make her that was bruised a remnant, and her that was rejected a mighty nation: and the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth, even for ever.
Hold a feast to me, ye islands: for the princes shall renew their strength: let them draw nigh and speak together: then let them declare judgment.
Who raised up righteousness from the east, and called it to his feet, so that it should go? shall appoint it an adversary of Gentiles, and shall dismay kings, and bury their swords in the earth, and cast forth their bows and arrows as sticks?
And he shall pursue them; the way of his feet shall proceed in peace.
Who has wrought and done these things? he has called it who called it from the generations of old; I God, the first and to all futurity, I AM.
The nations saw, and feared; the ends of the earth drew nigh, and came together,
every one judging for his neighbor and that to assist his brother: and one will say,
The artificer has become strong, and the coppersmith that smites with the hammer, and forges also: sometimes he will say, It is a piece well joined: they have fastened them with nails; they will fix them, and they shall not be moved.
But thou, Israel, art my servant Jacob, and he whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraam, whom I have loved:
whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and from the high places of it I have called thee, and said to thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and I have not forsaken thee.
Fear not; for I am with thee: wander not; for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee; and I have helped thee, and have established thee with my just right hand.
Behold, all thine adversaries shall be ashamed and confounded; for they shall be as if they were not: and all thine opponents shall perish.
Thou shalt seek them, and thou shalt not find the men who shall insolently rage against thee: for they shall be as if they were not, and they that war against thee shall not be.
For I am thy God, who holdeth thy right hand, who saith to thee,
Fear not, Jacob, and thou Israel few in number; I have helped thee, saith thy God, he that redeems thee, O Israel.
Behold, I have made thee as new saw-shaped threshing wheels of a waggon; and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat the hills to powder, and make them as chaff:
and thou shalt winnow them, and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them: but thou shalt rejoice in the holy ones of Israel.
And the poor and the needy shall exult; for when they shall seek water, and there shall be none, and their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord God, I the God of Israel will hear, and will not forsake them:
but I will open rivers on the mountains, and fountains in the midst of plains: I will make the desert pools of water, and a thirsty land watercourses.
I will plant in the dry land the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress, and white poplar:
that they may see, and know, and perceive, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has wrought these works, and the Holy One of Israel has displayed them.
Your judgment draws nigh, saith the Lord God; your counsels have drawn nigh, saith the King of Jacob.
Let them draw nigh, and declare to you what things shall come to pass; or tell us what things were of old, and we will apply our understanding, and we shall know what are the last and the future things:
tell us, declare ye to us the things that are coming on at the last time, and we shall know that ye are gods: do good, and do evil, and we shall wonder, and see at the same time
whence ye are, and whence is your works: they have chosen you an abomination out of the earth.
But I have raised up him that comes from the north, and him that comes from the rising of the sun: they shall be called by my name: let the princes come, and as potter's clay, and as a potter treading clay, so shall ye be trodden down.
For who will declare the things from the beginning, that we may know also the former things, and we will say that they are true? there is no one that speaks beforehand, nor anyone that hears your words.
I will give dominion to Sion, and will comfort Jerusalem by the way.
For from among the nations, behold, there was no one; and of their idols there was none to declare anything: and if I should ask them, Whence are ye? they could not answer me.
For these are your makers, as ye think, and they that cause you to err in vain.
Give of thy bread to the hungry, and of thy garments to them that are naked; and according to thine abundance give alms: and let not thine eye be envious, when thou givest alms.
Pour out thy bread on the burial of the just, but give nothing to the wicked.
Ask counsel of all that are wise, and despise not any counsel that is profitable.
Bless the Lord thy God alway, and desire of him that thy ways may be directed, and that all thy paths and counsels may prosper: for every nation hath not counsel; but the Lord himself giveth all good things, and he humbleth whom he will, as he will; now therefore, my son, remember my commandments, neither let them be put out of thy mind.
And now I signify this to they that I committed ten talents to Gabael the son of Gabrias at Rages in Media.
And fear not, my son, that we are made poor: for thou hast much wealth, if thou fear God, and depart from all sin, and do that which is pleasing in his sight.
Blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven, and who sins are covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin, and whose mouth there is no guile.
Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old, from my crying all the day.
For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: I became thoroughly miserable while a thorn was fastened in me. Pause.
I acknowledged my sin, and hid not mine iniquity: I said, I will confess mine iniquity to the Lord against myself; and thou forgavest the ungodliness of my heart. Pause.
Therefore shall every holy one pray to thee in a fit time: only in the deluge of many waters they shall not come nigh to him.
Thou art my refuge from the affliction that encompasses me; my joy, to deliver me from them that have compassed me. Pause.
I will instruct thee and guide thee in this way wherein thou shalt go: I will fix mine eyes upon thee.
Be ye not as horse and mule, which have no understanding; but thou must constrain their jaws with bit and curb, lest they should come nigh to thee.
Many are the scourges of the sinner: but him that hopes in the Lord mercy shall compass about.
Be glad in the Lord, and exult, ye righteous: and glory, all ye that are upright in heart.
And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the wilderness of Sin, according to their encampments, by the word of the Lord; and they encamped in Raphidin: and there was no water for the people to drink.
And the people reviled Moses, saying, Give us water, that we may drink; and Moses said to them, Why do ye revile me, and why tempt ye the Lord?
And the people thirsted there for water, and there the people murmured against Moses, saying, Why is this? hast thou brought us up out of Egypt to slay us and our children and our cattle with thirst?
And Moses cried to the Lord, saying, What shall I do to this people? yet a little while and they will stone me.
And the Lord said to Moses, Go before this people, and take to thyself of the elders of the people; and the rod with which thou smotest the river, take in thine hand, and thou shalt go.
Behold, I stand there before thou come, on the rock in Choreb, and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out from it, and the people shall drink. And Moses did so before the sons of Israel.
And he called the name of that place, Temptation, and Reviling, because of the reviling of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the Lord, saying, Is the Lord among us or not?
And Amalec came and fought with Israel in Raphidin.
And Moses said to Joshua, Choose out for thyself mighty men, and go forth and set the army in array against Amalec to-morrow; and, behold, I shall stand on the top of the hill, and the rod of God will be in my hand.
And Joshua did as Moses said to him, and he went out and set the army in array against Amalec, and Moses and Aaron and Or went up to the top of the hill.
And it came to pass, when Moses lifted up his hands, Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hands, Amalec prevailed.
But the hands of Moses were heavy, and they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat upon it; and Aaron and Or supported his hands one on this side and the other on that, and the hands of Moses were supported till the going down of the sun.
And Joshua routed Amalec and all his people with the slaughter of the sword.
And the Lord said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and speak this in the ears of Joshua; for I will utterly blot out the memorial of Amalec from under heaven.
And Moses built an altar to the Lord, and called the name of it, The Lord my Refuge.
For with a secret hand the Lord wages war upon Amalec to all generations.
And Elius further continued, and said,
Wait for me yet a little while, that I may teach thee: for there is yet speech in me.
Having fetched my knowledge from afar, and according to my works,
I will speak just things truly, and thou shalt not unjustly receive unjust words.
But know that the Lord will not cast off an innocent man: being mighty in strength of wisdom,
But he will hearken to the righteous: and he has said that they shall turn from unrighteousness.
But he preserves not the ungodly; because they are not willing to know the Lord, and because when reproved they were disobedient.
Therefore let their soul die in youth, and their life be wounded by messengers of death.
Because they afflicted the weak and helpless: and he will vindicate the judgment of the meek.
there is a deep gulf and a rushing stream beneath it, and thy table came down full of fatness. Judgment shall not fail from the righteous;
but there shall be wrath upon the ungodly, by reason of the ungodliness of the bribes which they received for iniquities.
Let not thy mind willingly turn thee aside from the petition of the feeble that are in distress.
But take heed lest thou do that which is wrong: for of this thou has made choice because of poverty.
Behold, the Mighty One shall prevail by his strength: for who is powerful as he is?
And who is he that examines his works? or who can say, he has wrought injustice?
Remember that his works are great beyond those which men have attempted.
Every man has seen in himself, how many mortals are wounded.
And the drops of rain are numbered by him, and shall be poured out in rain to form a cloud.
The ancient heavens shall flow, and the clouds overshadow innumerable mortals: he has fixed a time to cattle, and they know the order of rest. Yet by all these things thy understanding is not astonished, neither is thy mind disturbed in thy body.
And it came to pass after Saul was dead, that David returned from smiting Amalec, and David abode two days in Sekelac.
And it came to pass on the third day, that, behold, a man came from the camp, from the people of Saul, and his garments were rent, and earth was upon his head: and it came to pass when he went in to David, that he fell upon the earth, and did obeisance to him.
And David said to him, Whence comest thou? and he said to him, I have escaped out of the camp of Israel.
And David said to him, What is the matter? tell me. And he said, The people fled out of the battle, and many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and Jonathan his son are dead.
And David said to the young man who brought him the tidings, How knowest thou that Saul and Jonathan his son are dead?
And the young man that brought the tidings, said to him, I happened accidentally to be upon mount Gelbue; and, behold, Saul was leaning upon his spear, and, behold, the chariots and captains of horse pressed hard upon him.
And he looked behind him, and saw me, and called me; and I said, Behold, here am I.
And he said to me, Who art thou? and I said, I am an Amalekite.
And he said to me, Stand, I pray thee, over me, and slay me, for a dreadful darkness has come upon me, for all my life is in me.
So I stood over him and slew him, because I knew he would not live after he was fallen; and I took the crown that was upon his head, and the bracelet that was upon his arm, and I have brought them hither to my lord.
And David laid hold of his garments, and rent them; and all the men who were with him rent their garments.
And they lamented, and wept, and fasted till evening, for Saul and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of Juda, and for the house of Israel, because they were smitten with the sword.
And David said to the young man who brought the tidings to him, Whence art thou? and he said, I am the son of an Amalekite sojourner.
And David said to him, How was it thou wast not afraid to lift thy hand to destroy the anointed of the Lord?
And David called one of his young men, and said, Go and fall upon him: and he smote him, and he died.
And David said to him, Thy blood be upon thine own head; for thy mouth has testified against thee, saying, I have slain the anointed of the Lord.
And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and over Jonathan his son.
And he gave orders to teach it the sons of Juda: behold, it is written in the book of Right.
Set up a pillar, O Israel, for the slain that died upon thy high places: how are the mighty fallen!
Tell it not in Geth, and tell it not as glad tidings in the streets of Ascalon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.
Ye mountains of Gelbue, let not dew no rain descend upon you, nor fields of first-fruits be upon you, for there the shield of the mighty ones has been grievously assailed; the shield of Saul was not anointed with oil.
From the blood of the slain, and from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan returned not empty; and the sword of Saul turned not back empty.
Saul and Jonathan, the beloved and the beautiful, were not divided: comely were they in their life, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, and they were stronger than lions.
Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, who clothed you with scarlet together with your adorning, who added golden ornaments to your apparel.
How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle! O Jonathan, even the slain ones upon thy high places!
I am grieved for thee, my brother Jonathan; thou wast very lovely to me; thy love to me was wonderful beyond the love of women.
How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!
Then Joshua called together the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse,
and said to them, Ye have heard all that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and ye have hearkened to my voice in all that he commanded you.
Ye have not deserted your brethren these many days: until this day ye have kept the commandment of the Lord your God.
And now the Lord our God has given our brethren rest, as he told them: now then return and depart to your homes, and to the land of your possession, which Moses gave you on the other side Jordan.
But take great heed to do the commands and the law, which Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you to do; to love the Lord our God, to walk in all his ways, to keep his commands, and to cleave to him, and serve him with all your mind, and with all your soul.
And Joshua blessed them, and dismissed them; and they went to their homes.
And to one half the tribe of Manasse Moses gave a portion in the land of Basan, and to the other half Joshua gave a portion with his brethren on the other side of Jordan westward: and when Joshua sent them away to their homes, then he blessed them.
And they departed with much wealth to their houses, and they divided the spoil of their enemies with their brethren; very much cattle, and silver, and gold, and iron, and much raiment.
So the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse, departed from the children of Israel in Selo in the land of Chanaan, to go away into Galaad, into the land of their possession, which they inherited by the command of the Lord, by the hand of Moses.
And they came to Galaad of Jordan, which is in the land of Chanaan: and the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse built there an altar by Jordan, a great altar to look at.
And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse have built an altar at the borders of the land of Chanaan at Galaad of Jordan, on the opposite side to the children of Israel.
And all the children of Israel gathered together to Selo, so as to go up and fight against them.
And the children of Israel sent to the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and to the sons of the half tribe of Manasse into the land of Galaad, both Phinees the son of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest,
and ten of the chiefs with him; there was one chief of every household out of all the tribes of Israel; (the heads of families are the captains of thousands in Israel.)
Lo! did not Achar the son of Zara commit a trespass taking of the accursed thing, and there was wrath on the whole congregation of Israel? and he himself died alone in his own sin.
And the sons of Ruben, and the sons of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse answered, and spoke to the captains of the thousands of Israel, saying,
God even God is the Lord, and God even God himself knows, and Israel he shall know; if we have transgressed before the Lord by apostasy, let him not deliver us this day.
And if we have built to ourselves an altar, so as to apostatize from the Lord our God, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of whole-burnt-offerings, so as to offer upon it a sacrifice of peace-offering, the Lord shall require it.
But we have done this for the sake of precaution concerning this thing, saying, Lest hereafter your sons should say to our sons, What have ye to do with the Lord God of Israel?
Whereas the Lord has set boundaries between us and you, even Jordan, and ye have no portion in the Lord: so your sons shall alienate our sons, that they should not worship the Lord.
And we gave orders to do thus, to build this altar, not for burnt-offerings, nor for meat-offerings;
but that this may be a witness between you and us, and between our posterity after us, that we may do service to the Lord before him, with our burnt-offerings and our meat-offerings and our peace-offerings: so your sons shall not say to our sons, hereafter, Ye have no portion in the Lord.
And we said, If ever it should come to pass that they should speak so to us, or to our posterity hereafter; then shall they say, Behold the likeness of the altar of the Lord, which our fathers made, not for the sake of burnt-offerings, nor for the sake of meat-offerings, but it is a witness between you and us, and between our sons.
Far be it from us therefore that we should turn away from the Lord this day so as to apostatize from the Lord, so as that we should build an altar for burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, besides the altar of the Lord which is before his tabernacle.
And Phinees the priest and all the chiefs of the congregation of Israel who were with him heard the words which the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse spoke; and it pleased them.
And Phinees the priest said to the sons of Ruben, and to the sons of Gad, and to the half of the tribe of Manasse, To-day we know that the Lord is with us, because ye have not trespassed grievously against the Lord, and because ye have delivered the children of Israel out of the hand of the Lord.
So Phinees the priest and the princes departed from the children of Ruben, and from the children of Gad, and from the half tribe of Manasse out of Galaad into the land of Chanaan to the children of Israel; and reported the words to them.
And it pleased the children of Israel; and they spoke to the children of Israel, and blessed the God of the children of Israel, and told them to go up no more to war against the others to destroy the land of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse: so they dwelt upon it.
And Joshua gave a name to the altar of the children of Ruben, and the children of Gad, and the half tribe of Manasse; and said, It is a testimony in the midst of them, that the Lord is their God.
And Debbora and Barac son of Abineem sang in that day, saying,
A revelation was made in Israel when the people were made willing: Praise ye the Lord.
Hear, ye kings, and hearken, rulers: I will sing, it is I who will sing to the Lord, it is I, I will sing a psalm to the Lord the god of Israel.
O Lord, in thy going forth on Seir, when thou wentest forth out of the land of Edom, the earth quaked and the heaven dropped dews, and the clouds dropped water.
The mountains were shaken before the face of the Lord Eloi, this Sina before the face of the Lord God of Israel.
In the days of Samegar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, they deserted the ways, and went in by-ways; they went in crooked paths.
The mighty men in Israel failed, they failed until Debbora arose, until she arose a mother in Israel.
They chose new gods; then the cities of rulers fought; there was not a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel.
My heart inclines to the orders given in Israel; ye that are willing among the people, bless the Lord.
Ye that mount a she-ass at noon-day, ye that sit on the judgment-seat, and walk by the roads of them that sit in judgment by the way; declare
ye that are delivered from the noise of disturbers among the drawers of water; there shall they relate righteous acts: O Lord, increase righteous acts in Israel: then the people of the Lord went down to the cities.
Awake, awake, Debbora; awake, awake, utter a song: arise, Barac, and lead thy captivity captive, son of Abineem.
Then went down the remnant to the strong, the people of the Lord went down for him among the mighty ones from me.
Ephraim rooted them out in Amalec, behind thee was Benjamin among thy people: the inhabitants of Machir came down with me searching out the enemy, and from Zabulon came they that draw with the scribe's pen of record.
And princess in Issachar were with Debbora and Barac, thus she sent Barac on his feet in the valleys into the portions of Ruben; great pangs reached to the heart.
Why did they sit between the sheep-folds to hear the bleating of flocks for the divisions of Ruben? there were great searchings of heart.
Galaad is on the other side of Jordan where he pitched his tents; and why does Dan remain in ships? Aser sat down on the sea-coasts, and he will tabernacle at his ports.
The people Zabulon exposed their soul to death, and Nephthali came to the high places of their land.
Kings set themselves in array, then the kings of Chanaan fought in Thanaach at the water of Mageddo; they took no gift of money.
The stars from heaven set themselves in array, they set themselves to fight with Sisara out of their paths.
The brook of Kison swept them away, the ancient brook, the brook Kison: my mighty soul will trample him down.
When the hoofs of the horse were entangled, his mighty ones earnestly hasted
to curse Meroz: Curse ye it, said the angel of the Lord; cursed is every one that dwells in it, because they came not to the help of the Lord, to his help among the mighty.
Blessed among women be Jael wife of Chaber the Kenite; let her be blessed above women in tents.
He asked for water, she gave him milk in a dish; she brought butter of princes.
She stretched forth her left hand to the nail, and her right to the hand workman's hammer, and she smote Sisara with it, she nailed through his head and smote him; she nailed through his temples.
He rolled down between her feet; he fell and lay between her feet; he bowed and fell: where he bowed, there he fell dead.
The mother of Sisara looked down through the window out of the loophole, saying, Why was his chariot ashamed? why did the wheels of his chariots tarry?
Her wise ladies answered her, and she returned answers to herself, saying,
Will they not find him dividing the spoil? he will surely be gracious to every man: there are spoils of dyed garments for Sisara, spoils of various dyed garments, dyed embroidered garments, they are the spoils for his neck.
Thus let all thine enemies perish, O Lord: and they that love him shall be as the going forth of the sun in his strength.
And the Lord said to me, Go yet, and love a woman that loves evil things, an adulteress, even as the Lord loves the children of Israel, and they have respect to strange gods, and love cakes of dried grapes.
So I hired her to myself for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a flagon of wine.
And I said unto her, Thou shalt wait for me many days; and thou shalt not commit fornication, neither shalt thou be for another man; and I will be for thee.
For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an altar, and without a priesthood, and without manifestations.
And afterward shall the children of Israel return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king; and shall be amazed at the Lord and at his goodness in the latter days.
And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying,
Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, I am the Lord your God.
Ye shall not do according to the devices of Egypt, in which ye dwelt: and according to the devices of the land of Chanaan, into which I bring you, ye shall not do; and ye shall not walk in their ordinances.
Ye shall observe my judgments, and shall keep my ordinances, and shall walk in them: I am the Lord your God.
So ye shall keep all my ordinances, and all my judgments, and do them; which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the Lord your God.
No man shall draw nigh to any of his near kindred to uncover their nakedness; I am the Lord.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother, for she is thy mother; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's wife; it is thy father's nakedness.
The nakedness of thy sister by thy father or by thy mother, born at home or abroad, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.
The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or thy daughter's daughter, their nakedness thou shalt not uncover; because it is thy nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of the daughter of thy father's wife; she is thy sister by the same father: thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister, for she is near akin to thy father.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, for she is near akin to thy mother.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother, and thou shalt not go in to his wife; for she is thy relation.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter-in-law, for she is thy son's wife, thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.
Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it is thy brother's nakedness.
The nakedness of a woman and her daughter shalt thou not uncover; her son's daughter, and her daughter's daughter, shalt thou not take, to uncover their nakedness, for they are thy kinswomen: it is impiety.
Thou shalt not take a wife in addition to her sister, as a rival, to uncover her nakedness in opposition to her, while she is yet living.
And thou shalt not go in to a woman under separation for her uncleanness, to uncover her nakedness.
And thou shalt not lie with thy neighbour's wife, to defile thyself with her.
And thou shalt not give of thy seed to serve a ruler; and thou shalt not profane my holy name; I am the Lord.
And thou shalt not lie with a man as with a woman, for it is an abomination.
Neither shalt thou lie with any quadruped for copulation, to be polluted with it: neither shall a woman present herself before any quadruped to have connexion with it; for it is an abomination.
Do not defile yourselves with any of these things; for in all these things the nations are defiled, which I drive out before you,
and the land is polluted; and I have recompensed their iniquity to them because of it, and the land is aggrieved with them that dwell upon it.
And ye shall keep all my statutes and all my ordinances, and ye shall do none of these abominations; neither the native, nor the stranger that joins himself with you:
(for all these abominations the men of the land did who were before you, and the land was defiled,)
and lest the land be aggrieved with you in your polluting it, as it was aggrieved with the nations before you.
For whosoever shall do any of these abominations, the souls that do them shall be destroyed from among their people.
And ye shall keep mine ordinances, that ye may not do any of the abominable practices, which have taken place before your time: and ye shall not be polluted in them; for I am the Lord your God.
And Joseph said to them, This is it that I spoke to you, saying, ye are spies;
herein shall ye be manifested; by the health of Pharao, ye shall not depart hence, unless your younger brother come hither.
Send one of you, and take your brother; and go ye to prison, till your words be clear, whether ye speak the truth or not; but, if not, by the health of Pharao, verily ye are spies.
And bring your younger brother to me, and your words shall be believed; but, if not, ye shall die. And they did so.
And each said to his brother, Yes, indeed, for we are in fault concerning our brother, when we disregarded the anguish of his soul, when he besought us, and we hearkened not to him; and therefore has this affliction come upon us.
And Ruben answered them, saying, Did I not speak to you, saying, Hurt not the boy, and ye heard me not? and, behold, his blood is required.
And their father Jacob said to them, Ye have bereaved me. Joseph is not, Symeon is not, and will ye take Benjamin? all these things have come upon me.
And Ruben spoke to his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if I bring him not to thee; give him into my hand, and I will bring him back to thee.
But he said, My son shall not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he only has been left; and it shall come to pass that he is afflicted by the way by which ye go, then ye shall bring down my old age with sorrow to Hades.
If it had not been that the Lord was among us, let Israel now say;
if it had not been that the Lord was among us, when men rose up against us;
verily they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us:
verily the water would have drowned us, our soul would have gone under the torrent.
Yea, our soul would have gone under the overwhelming water.
Blessed be the Lord, who has not given us for a prey to their teeth.
Our soul has been delivered as a sparrow from the snare of the fowlers: the snare is broken, and we are delivered.
